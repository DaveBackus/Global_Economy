You are a junior analyst in Booz \& Company's emerging markets group, 
which advises companies on opportunities in developing economies.  
Your team's latest project:  assess the risks for a 
large international retailer thinking of entering the Indian market.  
Your role:  fiscal policy.  
From past experience, you know that your report should 
be a professional business document, 
no more than 5 pages long,  
and include
(i)~an analysis of taxes the company will pay and 
(ii)~an assessment of the risk of a fiscal crisis in the near future.  


Here are some topics you might want to cover:  
%
\begin{itemize}

\item The most important taxes the company will pay, their rates, 
and the difficulty of complying with local tax laws.   

\item A description of India's overall fiscal situation, 
including government revenue, spending, budget balance, 
government debt (all expressed as ratios to GDP).  

\item An analysis of the government debt dynamics.  
How do you expect the debt-to-GDP ratio evolve over the next 5 years?  

\item A qualitative discussion of factors  
that could lead to large increases in government expenditure 
in the future.  

\end{itemize}

From Amit: 

Hard to typify projects - there can be a huge spectrum, anything from country entry to a general country study. fiscal component - absolutely. please feel free to make one up.
 
some examples where we help clients with -
 
- do general country assessment for business climate
- do a country entry strategy for a specific product/service or general entry opportunity assessment (would include entry options like JVs, etc, and any regulatory constraints
- develop a business case for specific entry options and frame different scenarios by changing macro and micro variables (including regulatory and tax changes that may be coming up in the near future)
- assess the current limited footprint of a company in an emerging economy and develop a growth strategy given the business and policy climate
  
happy to continue the discussion and please let me know if there is anything i can do to help. perhaps other sources of information can be some people (e.g., some govt. official, partner in a consulting firm, CEO of a tech firm, etc.) in India and students can do video conference calls with them and have a set of questions to further inform their research efforts.
 
rgds,
Amit

2004 version:  

Germany experienced a record-high federal government budget deficit of 3.9\% of GDP in 2004. You
have been hired as a consultant by the manager of a European equity fund, who has asked you to
outline the prospects for the deficit over the next 2-5 years and its likely impact on the German
economy and stock market.  Your report should include:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item A description of the major categories of government revenue and spending.

\item A review of the events that led to the current deficit.  This should include a discussion of
the role of the European Union's stability pact.

\item An assessment of how the deficit and the government debt are likely to evolve, and how any
changes will affect the economy and asset returns.

\end{itemize}
