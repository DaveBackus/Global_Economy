It's the first day of your summer internship at DaimlerChrysler USA.
You are thrilled by the opportunity to market Mercedes to American consumers, 
but somewhat nervous about your new job.  
Your boss enters your office with your first assignment:  
summarize the macroeconomic conditions most likely to affect 
the US market for Mercedes over the next 12 months.  
She explains that growth, inflation, and interest rates 
have a direct impact on consumer spending, 
and that exchange rates affect your cost of production 
as well as that of your competitors.  
She asks, specifically, for you to read a number of 
industry forecasts and come up with your own synthesis for 
%
\begin{enumerate}
\topsep=0.05\bigskipamount
\itemsep=0.05\bigskipamount

\item Economic growth:  
the year-on-year growth rate of real GDP through the fourth quarter.  

\item Employment:  the year-on-year 
change in nonfarm payroll employment 
through December.  

\item Inflation:  
the year-on-year inflation rate through December 
(consumer price index).  

\item Interest rates:  the ``Fed Funds target rate'' reported 
after the March 27/28 meeting of the FOMC
(Federal Open Market Committee, 
the group that sets US monetary policy).  

\item Foreign exchange rates:  
the rates reported by the 
\href{http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/update/}
{Federal Reserve} at year-end for 
\begin{itemize}
\item the dollar price of one euro and 
\item the yen price of one dollar.  
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
Each item should include a brief rationale 
and an assessment of its likely impact on the production, pricing, and positioning of Mercedes in the US.  
% target:  5 pages + tables/figures
%Do you think they would affect the company's Chrysler brands 
%the same way?  


You barely remember your Global Economy course, 
but turn immediately to the course's 
\href{http://www.stern.nyu.edu/eco/b012303/Backus/ge_resources_db.htm}
{resource page} for help,
starting with the Economist Intelligence Unit's country data and country 
intelligence, 
%the Bloomberg economic calendar, 
the Cleveland Fed's {\it Economics Trends\/}, 
and the Philadelphia Fed's 
{\it Survey of Professional Forecasters\/}.
You also call a couple classmates and ask for their banks' forecasts.

\newpage
{\bf We  discussed this at some length in class, 
so what follows is extremely brief:  }  
\begin{enumerate}
\item GDP growth:  the numbers floating around are typically between 2.0 and 2.5\% (below average).  
Relevant information:  
Commonly mentioned sources of concern:  
flat yield curve, current account deficit, 
dozens of other short-run indicators.
Impact on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Production:  car sales are very cyclical, 
luxury brands possibly less so. 
In this case, you might suggest a modest decline in production
if the economy slows, as some expect.   
\item Pricing:  expect soft pricing in a soft market.  
\item Positioning:  Brands have to be coherent, but there's often room to 
change emphasis as market conditions change.  
In a boom, stress luxury, in a weak market maybe safety and reliability.  
\end{itemize}

\item Employment: another indicator of growth (employment typically goes up and down with GDP, and is closely watched on Wall Street).  
Relevant evidence:  Yahoo reports that the market expects an increase in 
nonfarm payroll (jobs) of 245k; last month the change was 108k.
The change of 245k translates into an annual growth rate of about 2\%, 
which is a little above average.  
The 108k for last month reminds us that 
there's a lot of month-to-month variation (noise?) in these monthly changes.
Implications:  same as above.  

\item Inflation:  typical numbers are 0.2 or 0.3\% 
(over a month! --- multiply by 12 to get an annual figure);  
energy prices are the major source of uncertainty.  
Relevant information:  
Bloomberg reports a consensus estimate of 0.2\% for December; 
actual inflation has been in the mid-3s over the last year, 
with a couple sharp spikes due to energy prices.  
Many analysts would look at both inflation 
and core inflation (``all items less food and energy'' in the report),
which excludes two volatile components.  
Impact on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Production:  little.  
Could effect future wages, hence cost of production.
\item Pricing:  you'd expect to be able to raise prices by the inflation 
rate, on average.  
Change in energy prices could affect demand for cars, esp those that 
are not fuel-efficient.  
\item Positioning:  little.  
\end{itemize}

\item Interest rates:  the Fed raised its target Fed Funds rate to 
4.25\% on December 13, and suggested that further increases might 
be coming.  
The Fed Fund futures market suggests a rate of 4.75\% at the end of 2006.
For the March meeting, good guesses would be 4.25\% or 4.50\%, since
changes typically come in round-number increments.  
Impact on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Production:  little.  
\item Pricing:  might make cars less affordable, 
but this is less likely with a luxury brand than (say) a 
mid-line Chrysler.  
\item Positioning:  little.  
\end{itemize}

\item Foreign exchange:  the simplest reasonable guess is no change, 
but there are lots of different views out there.  

Impact on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Production and pricing:  since Mercs are produced (in part) in Europe, 
an increase in the value of the euro would raise costs for dollar buyers.  
The reverse, of course, for a decrease.  
An increase would squeeze margins, leaving you with the choice of 
lower margins or smaller market share.  
The yen has a similar effect on Japanese producers of competing cars.  
If the yen falls and the euro rises, you get a double whammy:  
your costs have gone up, theirs have gone down.  
\item Positioning:  little.  
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
