You are delighted to have a summer internship at Citigroup Capital Markets.  
Your first rotation:  Fixed Income Research.  
On your first day, the Managing Director gives you a small project to get your feet wet. 
Noting that bond markets are driven largely by macroeconomic news, 
he asks you to write a report summarizing the prospects for the US 
economy over the coming year --- specifically, 
the year-on-year growth rate of industrial production.  
Your report should include:  
%
\begin{itemize}
\item A list of what you think are the most useful economic indicators
along with a short description of what they are and why you think they 
are useful.  

\item A statistical analysis of what each of these indicators implies  
for economic activity over the next 3-12 months.  

\item A combination forecast that aggregates  --- in some way --- 
the information in each of your chosen indicators into a 
12-month forecast of the growth rate of industrial production.  

\item A narrative to be shared with clients 
that weaves these ingredients into a coherent story 
about bond markets and the US economy.  
If appropriate, point out aspects of the current situation 
that are uncertain or difficult to explain.  
\end{itemize}
%
He hands you a spreadsheet containing a large number of 
economic indicators and walks away.

{\bf Sketch of a possible answer:}  
\begin{itemize}
\item Regression-based forecast.  Whatever you like.  
If you tried multiple indicators, you may have found that they 
point in different directions.  Welcome to the real world!   

\item Interest rate forecast.  The results of the calculations are

As with the euro calculations we did in class, the flat yield 
curve suggests that the market expected short rates to fall in the 
coming years.  

\item There's one issue you may need to face:  
the yield curve suggests declining interest rates, 
which would normally be associated with lower growth.  
If you forecast lower, growth, no problem:  you narrative might be 
that you see growth slowing and interest rates coming down, 
which is a common pattern.  
But if you see growth continuing at or near its historical average, 
which is what most analysts predict, 
then you might want to talk about why the yield curve is so flat.  
A common story is that world investment has been low. 
Another is some variant on ``bond markets have gone crazy.''  

Here's Lehman's version ({\it Global Outlook:  Plain Sailing --- For Now\/}):  
\begin{quote}

The yield curve has a venerable record as a leading indictor of recession: the 10s-funds spread has turned negative within a
year and a half of each of the past six recessions. 
However, history is littered with simple rules of thumb that fall
apart soon after the rule is discovered. Before blindly applying such rules it is important to understand why they work. In
particular, the yield curve works as a recession indicator precisely because it is a signal that the Fed is so serious about
fighting inflation that it is willing to risk recession. Past inversions have been associated with a 3-5\% real Fed funds rate.
How does that apply today? So far, the Fed’s ``measured” rate hikes have been designed to slow growth without causing a
financial accident. Most Fed officials view the low level of bond yields, and therefore the very flat yield curve, as a
``conundrum.” While it is possible that the bond market is telling the Fed that it is being too tough, so that a period of low
growth and low inflation lies ahead, we think it more likely low bond yields reflect a number of growth-stimulative factors.
Consider the non-policy explanations for the flat yield curve. The global savings glut, or more precisely the global shortage
of capital spending opportunities, is a net stimulus to the US economy: it means low demand for US capital goods exports,
but more important it means an inflow of cheap financing from overseas, stimulating the interest-sensitive parts of the US
economy. Massive buying of Treasury securities by Asian central banks has the same effect: this currency manipulation
hurts the US trade balance but stimulates interest-sensitive spending. Buying by duration-matching pension funds tends to
flatten the yield curve with no harm to the economy. And a flat yield curve resulting from less risk of growth and inflation
volatility is a net positive to the economy.
Perhaps the bond market is smarter than the Fed, the economics consensus and other financial markets (stocks, credit
markets and the housing market): or perhaps the yield curve is not a reliable predictor of weakness ahead.
