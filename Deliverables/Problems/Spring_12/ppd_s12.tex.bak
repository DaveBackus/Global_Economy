\begin{questions}

\question Purchasing power parity for Big Macs.
The Economist reports the following data for
local prices of Big Macs and US dollars in July 2011:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
        & Big Mac Price  &  Exchange Rate    \\
        &(Local Currency)&(LCUs per Dollar)   \\
\midrule
Argentina       &  20.0  &  4.13  \\
Brazil          &  9.50  &  1.54 \\
India           &  84.0  &  44.4   \\
United States   &  4.07  &  1.00   \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{parts}
\part What is the dollar price of a Big Mac in each of these locations?
\part How does the ratio of Big Mac prices compare to the real exchange rate?
\part What exchange rates for the first three currencies would
equate the dollar prices of Big Macs to the US price.
\part How much are the first three currencies over or undervalued
relative to the US dollar?
\end{parts}

\begin{solution}
\begin{parts}
\part 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
        & Big Mac Price  &  Exchange Rate & Big Mac Price\\
        &(Local Currency)&(LCUs per USD)  &    (USD)   \\
\midrule
Argentina       &  20.0  &  4.13  &  \\
Brazil          &  9.50  &  1.54 \\
India           &  84.0  &  44.4   \\
United States   &  4.07  &  1.00   \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\end{parts}
\end{solution}

\question Foreign exchange reserves.
Countries often buy and sell foreign currency as part of their
day-to-day central bank operations.

\begin{parts}
\part Describe the central bank's balance sheet.
Where do foreign exchange reserves appear?
\part If private citizens choose to buy foreign currency
from the central bank, what happens to its balance sheet?
What limits how much of this the central bank can accomodate?
\end{parts}


% --------------------------------------------------------------------
\question The trilemma in action.  In 1992, the Bank of England found
that its commitment to maintain a quasi-fixed parity of the pound against
the Deutschemark forced it to raise short-term interest rates during
a recession.
What were its choices?
How does this illustrate the trilemma?

% --------------------------------------------------------------------
\question Crisis triggers.
Economic crises have been with us throughout recorded history.
Although they often come as a surprise, their forms are familiar
from past experience.

\begin{parts}
\part What are the classic crisis triggers?
\part What indicators would you use to help assess
each source of crisis risk?
\part What are the standard responses to each one?
\part What would you do now if you were the benevolent dictator
of the European Union?
\end{parts}
