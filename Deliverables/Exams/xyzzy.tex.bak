\end{table}

\item  {\it Don't Cry for Me Argentina (40~points).\/}
Argentina is a seemingly endless source of entertainment to economists,
yet its economy has done well in the recent past.
GDP growth fell to 0.9\% in 2009, during the global financial crisis,
but averaged over 9\% the next two years.
Most analysts attribute this success to
favorable commodity prices and strong global demand for Argentina's commodity exports.

At the same time, the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner
continues to adopt policies that befuddle outside observers, including:
taking over private pension funds,
restricting imports and purchases of foreign currency,
attacking the press,
nationalizing the Spanish-owned oil company YPF,
imposing price controls on electricity, natural gas, and public transportation,
and subsidizing energy consumption.

The Economist Intelligence Unit reports:
\begin{itemize}
\item A US court case may eventually leave
Argentina with the unpalatable choice of repaying the ``holdouts'' (creditors that
did not participate in the 2005 or 2010 restructurings) in full --- something that it
has sworn never to do --- or falling into technical default to avoid repaying
current creditors in a US jurisdiction.

\item According to official data, consumer price inflation remains among the highest
in emerging markets, at 10.5\% in April 2013. However, the official data are
widely discredited, and we are now using estimates produced by PriceStats,
which estimates that inflation in 2012 was 25\%.

\item Double-digit inflation has generated real peso appreciation.
Foreign-exchange controls have failed to prevent an erosion of the reserves cushion,
heightening the risk of an eventual devaluation.

\item The Argentine peso floats in principle, but the central bank intervenes to limit
the peso's depreciation.
In addition, foreign currency transactions are subject to a variety of controls.
For the past couple of years, the government has been gradually tightening the `clamp,'
an unofficial policy of discouraging purchases of dollars.
As a result, the peso's official decline has been modest,
but the unofficial ``blue market'' price of the peso is considerably lower.

\item The (low) banking sector risk rating reflects weak economic activity, expansionary
monetary policies that contribute to credit risk, high risk of exchange-rate
and interest-rate volatility, and increased currency convertibility risk.

\item The ruling party fared badly in the October midterm election,
 leaving the president without enough support in Congress
 to change the constitution and run for re-election.
 Focus will now shift rapidly to the 2015 presidential race.
 The president remains alienated from almost all of the country's most influential groups,
including the unions, the media, the Catholic Church and the traditional
leaders of the Peronist party. In this context, risks to political stability will be
high. An additional risk to stability is the president's health.
\end{itemize}
%
The question is what happens next:  Could another crisis be on the way,
or has Argentina put its problematic past to rest?
Use the information provided, and your own experience and good judgement,
to assess the risks to the Argentina economy over the next 2-3 years.
%
\begin{parts}
\item By ``real appreciation'' we mean an increase in the price
of local goods relative to foreign goods ---
what is sometimes called a decline in the real exchange rate.
Use the numbers in the table to demonstrate (or disprove) real appreciation
of the peso.
(10~points)

\item Why do you think the central bank's foreign exchange reserves have declined?
(5~points)

\item How do you see government debt evolving?
Compute, in particular, the ratio of government debt to GDP at year-end 2013.
What factors contribute the most to the change in the ratio?
(10~points)

\item Overall, how would you rate the risk of a macroeconomic crisis in Argentina?
What are the biggest sources of concern?
(15~points)
\end{parts}

\begin{solution}
\begin{parts}
\item The debt dynamics equation is
\begin{eqnarray*}
   \Delta (B_t/Y_t)  &=&  (i_t - \pi_t)(B_{t-1}/Y_{t-1})
                - g_t (B_{t-1}/Y_{t-1}) + D_t/Y_t .
\end{eqnarray*}
The three terms are
\begin{eqnarray*}
    (i_t - \pi_t)(B_{t-1}/Y_{t-1}) &=& (0.042 - 0.004) (118.2) \;\;=\;\; 4.5  \\                - g_t (B_{t-1}/Y_{t-1})   &=& - (-0.030) (118.2) \;\;=\;\; 3.5 \\
    D_t/Y_t  &=&  0.5 .
\end{eqnarray*}
Their total is 8.5, so the ratio of debt to GDP will rise from 118.2 to 126.7.

Grading:  3 points for each component done right, 1 more for summing them.

\item This involves the first term above.  If we increase the interest rate paid
by 2\%, that adds $ 0.02 \times 118.2 = 2.4$,
so you get an additional increase in debt of 2.4\% of GDP.
Similarly, a decline of 2\% leads to a decline in debt of the same amount.
Given the large difference between the interest rate paid on the debt
and the current market rate, it seems more likely the rate will go up
than go down.

Grading: 7 points for the calculation, 3 for noting the difference
between the rate paid and the market.

\item This is a call for the checklist:
\begin{itemize}
\item Debt and deficits.
(i)~The calculation shows us debt is still rising, although a substantial part
comes from a shrinking economy.
(ii)~Contingent liabilities.

\item Banks.
The EIU suggests that banks could be collateral damage
from a bad economy.

\item Exchange rates and reserves.  Not relevant here,
Portugal is part of the Euro Zone and does not have any control over
its exchange rate.

\item Politics.  Always an issue, but the EIU thinks
it's mostly under control.
\end{itemize}
The biggest risk seems to be that the government is unable to get
the budget under control.
If it does, the debt could be a good deal.
Should you buy some? It's a risky bet, for sure.
To me, the fiscal situation is bad enough that I'd stay away.
But there's some upside if they turn it around,
and if they continue to get favorable terms from the troika.

Grading:  15 points for the checklist and its components,
5 points for a sensible argument assessing the various risks.
\end{parts}

\item  {\it The supply and demand of Abenomics (30~points).\/}
Shinzo Abe was elected Prime Minister of Japan in December 2012
after two decades of slow growth and falling prices.
He pledged dramatic policy changes to revive the Japanese economy,
dubbed the ``three arrows'' of ``Abenomics.''
We consult the Economist Intelligence Unit for specifics:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Fiscal stimulus.  A sizeable economic stimulus package was passed by parliament in
February 2013, and a smaller one in October.
This is expected to produce a budget deficit of 8\% in 2013.
\item Monetary stimulus. A plan to double Japan's
money supply within two years was implemented in April 2013 to help to achieve the Bank of Japan's
target of 2\%  inflation.
\item Structural reform.
This is less clearly articulated, but some observers hope for a range of micro-based reforms,
including loosening product-market regulations that reduce productivity,
tightening corporate requirements for funding pensions,
creating a more flexible labor market,
and reducing subsidies to an inefficient agricultural sector.
\end{itemize}
%
Your mission is to explore the impact of the three arrows using the aggregate supply and demand
framework.
\begin{parts}
\item Explain, for each ``arrow,'' whether it affects supply or demand.
Which way does each one shift the appropriate curve(s)?
(15~points)
\item Compare the short- and long-term impact of the three policies.
Which are likely to have the greatest impact in the short term?
In the long term?
(15~points)

\begin{parts}
\item An increase in the money supply shifts aggregate demand to the right.
The new curve is represented in the diagram by AD$'$.

Grading: 5 points for noting which curve to shift, and which direction.

\item In the short run, we move from A to B.  Prices and output both rise.
In the long run, we move to C, where we see (relative to A) that the only impact is on prices.

Grading: 5 points for the short run, 5 points for the long run.

\item The traditional goals are (i) output equal to $Y^*$ and
(ii) stable prices.
We miss on both in the short run and the long run.
The best policy is to stay at A.

Grading:  5 points for a clear statement of the goals,
5 points for noting the difference between them and the policy under
consideration.

\item The quantity theory equation is
\begin{eqnarray*}
    M V &=& P Y ,
\end{eqnarray*}
where $M$ is the money supply, $V$ is velocity,
$P$ is the price level, and $Y$ is real output.
If $V$ is constant, an increase in $M$ increases some combination
of $P$ and $Y$.

Grading:  5 points for the equation, 5 points for noting its consequences.

\item We found the same in our AS/AD analysis,
but in the latter
we also had a way to determine how much of each,
and how that changes over different time horizons.

Grading:  5 points for some commentary along these lines.

\begin{parts}
\item  How sensitive to the business cycle would you expect demand for Rolex watches to be?
Why?
(10~points)

\item If US inflation jumped to 5\%, how would you expect
interest rates to respond?  Why?
(10~points)

\item  Given what you know about global economic conditions,
how would you expect the US dollar to perform over the next year versus the euro?  Why?
(10~points)

\item Consider the statement:  ``Tax deductions are good, because they save taxpayers money.''
Do you agree or disagree?  Why?
(10~points)
\end{parts}

\begin{solution}
\begin{parts}
\item The largest correlation should be in the lower-right quadrant,
like the ccf for the unemployment rate in Figure 11.3 of the book.
Your figure should be labeled correctly, with leads to the left and
lags to the right.

\item The Taylor rule calculation is something like this:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    i &=& r^* + \pi + 0.5 (\pi - \pi^*) + 0.5 (g - g^*) .
\end{eqnarray*}
The US targets are
$ r^* = 2$, $\pi^* = 2$, and $g^* = 3$.
If we use the same, we get $i = 1.8$.

Grading:  5 points for a correct formula for the Taylor rule,
5 for applying it in this way or something close.

\item Let's say the PBOC's balance sheet looks something like this:
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lr|lr}
               Assets  &     &     Liabilities                     \\
               \hline
               FX Reserves &  100 &     Money &  200   \\
               Bonds   & 100 & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
If the PBOC purchases 50 worth of foreign currency,
it changes to
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lr|lr}
               Assets  &     &     Liabilities                     \\
               \hline
               FX Reserves &  150 &     Money  &  250   \\
               Bonds   & 100 & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
Note that (the supply of) money has gone up:  when it bought foreign currency,
it issued local currency in return.
The PBOC can undo this by selling 50 of bonds, taking money
in exchange:
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lr|lr}
               Assets  &     &     Liabilities                     \\
               \hline
               FX Reserves &  150 &     Money  &  200   \\
               Bonds   & 50 & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
This transaction is referred to as ``sterilization.''

Grading:  5 points each for the describing the impact of the two transactions
on the balance sheet.

\item This is a PPP-like calculation:  goods are expensive in Canada,
so the Canadian dollar is overvalued.
We know from experience that this has no predictive value in the short term.

Grading:  5 points for noting the overvaluation, 5 for noting the lack
of predictive content.
