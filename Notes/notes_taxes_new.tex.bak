Taxes are a necessary feature of life:  
governments, like people and businesses, 
must finance their spending one way or another.  
Nevertheless, the way in which governments collect revenue 
can affect economic performance and welfare.  
The issue is not that taxes take purchasing power 
away from individuals; they do, but if spending must be financed,
that's really a question of whether the spending is socially useful.
We'll leave you to decide that for yourself.  
The issue is that taxes inevitably 
discourage some activities and encourage others. 
%and these incentives may not be in the public interest.
Taxes on labor income discourage work, 
taxes on capital income discourage saving and investment, 
and taxes on cigarettes discourage smoking.  
We'll leave cigarettes for another time, 
but the incentives to work and save are central to an economy's 
performance and worth a closer look.  


\subsubsection*{Social cost of taxes}

Taxes affect decisions.  
They insert a ``wedge'' (a difference) between 
private and social costs of various activities.
As a result, they generally lead to decisions that are socially inefficient:  
we could reallocate the same resources and raise everyone's welfare.  
The conditions for this ``invisible hand'' result should be 
familiar from your 
Firms \& Markets class:  
clear property rights, 
competitive firms (no monopolies), 
complete information, 
and absence of externalities 
(no direct impact of one person's actions on another's income or welfare). 
Under these conditions, the goal of a good tax system 
is to set tax rates that cover spending, 
but generate the least disruption to resource allocation:
to minimize the adverse incentives built into taxes.   

You can see how taxes affect decisions 
in a traditional supply and demand setting like that illustrated 
in Figure \ref{fig:tax}.  
The demand curve (labelled $D$) represents purchasers of the product; 
for any given quantity $Q$ it tells us how much buyers are willing to 
pay, hence what that many units are worth to them (at the margin).
The supply curve (labelled $S$) represents sellers. 
With competitive sellers, it tells us how much it costs to produce 
a given quantity (at the margin). 
The market clears at point A, where supply and demand are equal.

The social cost of imposing a tax that shifts the supply 
curve from $S$ to $S'$ is the triangle ABC.} 
\label{fig:tax} 
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Now suppose we charge a tax of a fixed amount per unit.
From the perspective of buyers, the supply curve has shifted up 
by the amount of the tax to (say) $S'$. 
Note that there is now a difference between the social cost 
(the marginal cost of production in terms of resources used) 
and the private cost (the price paid by buyers).  
The market now clears at B for buyers and C for sellers.  
This difference leads buyers and sellers to reduce the quantity 
of resources allocated to this product, 
leaving them to be used elsewhere in the economy. 
Buyers, of course, buy fewer units, because the price has gone up.  
Sellers offer fewer fewer units for sale, 
because the price to them has fallen.
The quantities depend on the slopes of the supply and demand curves.  


The social cost of the tax (the reduction in welfare it causes) 
is the area inside the triangle ABC.  
The upper part of the triangle is the loss of consumer surplus 
(the difference between what buyers pay and what the product is worth to them).  
The lower part of the triangle is the loss of producer surplus 
(the difference between what sellers receive and the cost of production).  
The sum is the social cost of the tax.  
You may recall a similar argument against monopolies.  
Both result in fewer resources devoted to the product
than we would like.   


There's a fine point here about who pays the tax.  
We could charge sellers or buyers with the same result.  
Governments sometimes prefer taxes on firms to taxes on 
people, in part because it makes the tax less visible to voters, 
but the impact on resource allocation should be the same.  


\subsubsection*{Principles of good tax systems} 


One objective of a good tax system is to minimize the social cost 
of taxes:  to raise tax revenue with as little impact as possible 
on resource allocation.  
We sometimes say we're looking for a resource-neutral tax system.  
This is an incredibly complicated issue, in both theory and practice, 
but there are a small number of principles we can use to guide us.  
Namely:  
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Broad tax base.  
Think about two ways of raising the same tax revenue:  
a low tax rate on a broad base and a higher rate on a narrower base.  
The former is generally better.  

%\item Tax inelastic products.  
%If you have a choice, you're better off taxing goods for which demand is 
%inelastic (insensitive to price).  

\item Avoid taxing inputs to production.   
Production should be efficient:  it should not be distorted by taxes.  
\end{enumerate}
%
Let's run through the logic for each.  


{\it Broad tax base.\/}  
Let's think about this using our supply and demand analysis.
Suppose we have two similar markets, each like the 
one we described in Figure \ref{fig:tax}.  
In the broad-base system, 
we tax the products in both markets at the same rate.  
The social cost is therefore double what we saw earlier:  
the triangle ABC for each market.  
The narrow base system consists of taxing one market 
at twice the rate.  
Which is better?

\caption{Social cost of doubling a tax. 
We double the tax rate by 
shifting the supply curve from $S$ to $S''$.
Note the social cost:  the triangle ADE is four times as big as ABC.}   
\label{fig:tax2} 
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


We'll use Figure \ref{fig:tax2} to see how this works.
There we have drawn three supply curves:  
$S$ refers to supply without the tax, 
$S'$ refers to supply with a small tax (the broad base system), 
and $S''$ refers to supply with a tax rate double that in $S'$
(the narrow base system).  
What is the social cost of the narrow base?  
Since the rate is higher, 
the welfare triangle is larger; 
it consists of the area ADE. 
If you look at this long enough, you'll realize that 
the area of ADE is four times that of ABC, 
which makes the social cost twice as large 
as the broad base system.  
The point in general is that broad-based tax systems are good, 
since they allow you to raise a given amount of revenue with 
a lower rate and smaller welfare cost.  
You'll hear lots of arguments for tax exemptions, 
but you rarely hear that they result in higher taxes on other things, 
which is the primary argument against them.    


\begin{comment}
{\it Tax inelastic products.} 
Another principle (one we'll ignore for the most part) 
is that the social cost of a tax on a good with inelastic demand 
is smaller than a similar tax on a good with elastic demand:  
so tax the goods with least elastic demand!    
The reasoning comes from the size of the welfare triangle:
if the demand curve is steeper, the triangle is smaller, 
so the social cost is smaller, too.  
[?? should we kill this?]
%  ??
%  not quite right -- see discussion in Chari and Kehoe re 
%  income and subst effects 
%  the argument is closer to true if we talk about income elasticities, 
%  but they don't fit into the S/D diagram 
\end{comment}

{\it Avoid taxing inputs.}
This is a more subtle principle, 
but an important one.
By inputs, we mean products that are used in the production 
of other products. 
We include intermediate goods, which are outputs for some
firms and inputs for others.
You might think of steel, high-fructose corn syrup, 
or consulting services, all of which are inputs into the 
production of something else.  
The principle is not to tax these things.  
Why?  Because it results in inefficient production.
You would be better off taxing only the final goods.
A value-added tax is one way to accomplish this.


High-fructose corn syrup is a good example.  
In the US, taxes (and quotas) on imported sugar make sugar expensive, 
which leads producers of soft drinks and candy to substitute 
high-fructose corn syrup, 
which uses more resources to produce 
but is nevertheless cheaper.  
In this case, some production moved outside the US, 
where it can avoid paying the tax.  
The point is not that the production is done elsewhere, 
but that the decision is driven by taxes, 
not the cost of resources used in production.  
Taxes have induced firms to use less efficient production
methods than they would otherwise.  
% sugar and ethanol ??


In practice, taxes on inputs sometimes lead 
inadvertently to very high taxes on final products. 
Consider a product that has five stages of production, 
each performed by a different firm.  
If each stage is charged a tax of 10\%, 
what is the total tax paid in the production 
of the product?  
Let's say total value added is five, with one 
unit of value added at each stage.  
The first-stage firm produces one unit of value.
This costs the second-stage firm 1.10, 
since it must pay a 10\% tax. 
This firm also adds one unit of value, 
and sells its output for a price of (including taxes) 
\[
    \left( 1.10 + 1 \right) \times 1.10 \;=\; 2.31.
\]
If you work through all five stages, 
you'll find that the price of the final product, 
including all the taxes paid, 
is 6.71 after the last stage, so the effective tax rate is 34.2\% 
[$(6.71-5.00)/5.00$].
The central problem, however, is the large difference 
in tax rates across the five stages of production.
The final stage only gets taxed once, so it pays a tax rate of 10\%, 
but the first stage gets taxed five times, so 
it's taxed at a rate of 61\% [$1.10^5 = 1.61$]!
This large difference in tax rates violates not only 
the second principle, but also the first one.


These differences in tax rates potentially lead to 
inefficient production, 
as firms look for substitutes for highly-taxed inputs, 
or integrate vertically, 
since taxes are assessed only when products are sold to the next producer.
This is one of the arguments for a value-added tax system.
With a value-added tax, firms pay tax on only the value-added of their 
stage of production, which eliminates the differences in tax rates 
paid by the different stages of production. 
A value-added tax system is equivalent to one in which we tax only the final good.    


\subsubsection*{Taxes and employment} 

The most important consequences of tax systems 
from an economy-wide perspective 
are their impact on decisions to work and save/invest.
Countries differ dramatically in both saving rates and employment rates, 
and some of these  differences arguably stem from 
differences in tax rates.  

Consider taxes on labor income.
Is it possible that taxes on labor income reduce work?  
The issue here cannot easily be addressed in a supply and demand diagram, 
because taxes generate both income and substitution effects, 
which depend not only on the tax, but how the tax revenue is spent.  
For that reason, we trace decisions directly to consumer preferences.


Suppose people like to consume goods and services, 
and they also enjoy leisure,
defined as time spent not working. 
If they spend a fraction $L$ of their time working, then $1-L$ is spent not working. 
Their work decision is then a tradeoff of the two:
they need to work to be able to afford consumption (a good thing), 
but work reduces their leisure (a bad thing).
Their work decision then balances these costs and benefits, 
with the price of work (the wage rate) as the equilibrating force.  
One way to describe preferences is with a utility function, 
a mathematical representation of what people like.  
Values of consumption and leisure that generate high values of utility 
are better than those that generate low values.  
A convenient example is 
\[
    U(C,1-L) \;=\; \log C + \gamma \log (1-L) .
\]
This says that both consumption and leisure are good, 
and $\gamma$ represents the importance of the latter.
High values of $\gamma$ represent strong preference for leisure, 
so we might expect them to lead to less work (other things equal).  


Now let's see how the decision to work depends on the wage.  
If the wage is $w$, then a person who works amount $L$ would 
receive income $wL$.  
In our setting, this would all be consumed, 
since that's the point of working:
$ C = wL$.  
Faced with this wage, our theoretical person would choose the work effort 
that maximizes her utility:  
\[
    \log C + \gamma \log (1-L) \;=\; \log (wL) + \gamma \log (1-L).  
\]
We can find the solution by setting the derivative with respect to $L$ 
equal to zero:
\begin{equation}
    1/L  - \gamma/(1-L) \;=\; 0 
    \label{eq:labor-foc}
\end{equation}
or $ L = 1/(1+\gamma)$.

You might notice two features of this solution. 
One is that the amount of work declines with $\gamma$:
if people have a strong preference for leisure (large $\gamma$), 
they will work less. 
In principle, we could use this to explain lower employment rates
in France than the US:  the French have higher $\gamma$s.
Most experts would be skeptical of this explanation.
We know, for example, that the French worked as 
about much as Americans in 1965.  
Did their $\gamma$ rise over the last thirty years?  Why?  
The second feature of the solution is that work does not depend on 
the wage.  
Does this make any sense?  
In fact, wages have gone up several times over the last century, 
with little impact on the amount of work effort. 
We have seen some changes ---
women work more, children and men less ---
but the total fraction of time spent working hasn't changed much, 
suggesting that this isn't a bad approximation.     
Theoretically, it represents a balance of income and substitution effects.
With a higher wage, leisure is more expensive, so we consume less of it 
(and work more).
But a higher wage also makes us richer, 
and part of this increase in our standard of living 
is used to consume more leisure (work less).
In our example, the two effects are equal:
they cancel each other out, 
leaving no impact of the wage on work.  


Now consider the impact of taxes.  
If the tax rate on labor income is $\tau$, 
then the after-tax wage is $(1-\tau) w$.
Changing the tax rate will have no effect on time spent working
for the same reason that changing the wage had no effect.
Were we wrong in our guess that taxes might reduce work effort?  
Maybe not. 
The government collects tax revenue from workers equal to $\tau w$, 
but it matters how this money is spent. 
Suppose all or part is given back to people in the form 
of transfer payments:  unemployment insurance, parenthood benefits, welfare, 
and so on. 
In this case, the income effect of the transfer may lead people to work less.
The details work like this.  
A typical person receives transfer payments $T$;
let us say, for now, that they are fixed, and do not depend
on anything a person might do.    
The transfer payment allows her to consume $ C = (1-\tau) w L + T$.
We maximize   
\[
    \log C + \gamma \log (1-L) = \log [(1-\tau) wL + T] + \gamma \log (1-L),  
\]
which leads to the first-order condition, 
\[ 
    (1-\tau) w/[(1-\tau) wL + T]  \;=\; \gamma/(1-L) .
    \label{eq:labor-foc-trans}
\] 
Let us say that transfer payments are a fraction $f$ of tax revenue:
$ T = f \tau w L$.  
Then a little algebra (well, maybe more than a little) tells us
$ L = 1/(1+\gamma^*) $, where 
\[ 
    \gamma^* \;=\; \gamma \; \frac{1-\tau(1-f)}{1-\tau} \geq \gamma .
\] 
In words:  an increase in the tax rate reduces work.  
If all the tax revenue is used to finance transfers ($f=1$), 
then $ \gamma^* =  \gamma/(1-\tau)$ and an increase in 
the tax rate is similar to an increase in preference for leisure.  


Numerical example.  
Let $w = 10$ and $\gamma = 4$.
With no transfers, 
work effort satisfies equation (\ref{eq:labor-foc}), so 
\[
    L \;=\; 1/(1+\gamma) \;=\; 0.2.  
\]
Now let $\tau = 0.25$ and suppose that half of all 
tax revenue goes to transfers ($ T = \tau w L/2 $).  
Then $ L = 0.18$, a fall of 10\%.  
The impact is larger with higher taxes and larger fractions
of tax revenue devoted to transfers.  


\begin{comment}
The bottom line:  taxes on labor income can reduce
time spent working if the tax revenue is returned
to households in the form of transfer payments.
There's some debate about this, but it seems to us 
to be what we see in some countries.  
There are lots of other features of tax systems 
that may influence work decisions in practice, 
including benefits tied explicitly to not working.  
Some experts argue that loss of benefits 
makes marginal tax rates on labor income 
extremely high in some countries, especially for low-income workers.  
\end{comment}


\subsubsection*{Taxes and saving} 

A high tax rate on capital income might be expected 
to discourage investment, leading the economy to have less capital
than otherwise. 
This in turn would reduce wages, since 
the marginal product of labor is lower if we have less capital. 
So what is an appropriate tax rate on capital income?  
Many economists argue that taxes on capital income should be zero.  
People would eventually pay tax on capital income indirectly 
when they consume the proceeds, but not before then.  
The logic follows our second principle, 
since capital is an input into the production of future output.  

Let's think about how households allocate their income over time. 
Suppose we have two dates (labeled ``0'' and ``1'').
If a household earns labor income $(Y_0,Y_1)$ at the two dates  
and receives 
a (real) interest rate $r$ on saving, 
then saving is $ S = Y_0 - C_0$ and 
consumption at date 1 must be 
$ C_1 = (1+r) S + Y_1 $.  
We can put the two together in the present value relation, 
\[
    C_0 + C_1/(1+r) \;=\;  Y_0 + Y_1/(1+r) .
\]
This tells us, in essence, that the price of date-1 consumption
is $1/(1+r)$.  
If we had more periods, we'd have a similar relation, 
with prices of $1/(1+r)$, $1/(1+r)^2$, $1/(1+r)^3$, etc., 
for consumption at dates 1, 2, 3, etc.  


Now think about taxes.  If we tax interest income, this changes 
the price of future consumption.
For a given real interest rate $r$, 
a higher tax rate increases the price of future consumption, 
which you might expect to favor current consumption.  
If the tax rate on capital income is $\tau$, 
then the after-tax interest rate is $ (1-\tau) r$
and the price of consumption $n$ periods in the future
is $ 1/[1+(1-\tau)r]^n $.
This may not seem like a big deal, 
but with the mythical power of compound interest, 
it can increase the price of future consumption dramatically.    
Consider a numerical example with $r = 0.04$ (4\% a year)  
and a tax rate of $\tau = 0.25$ (25\%).
With no tax, the price of consumption one period in the future
is 0.9615 [$=1/(1+r)$].    
With the tax, this increases to 0.9709 [$=1/[1+(1-\tau)r]$], 
a modest difference.
If the number of periods is large, the differences can be large, too.
Suppose $n=25$; think of a 35-year-old consultant saving for 
her retirement.  
Then the tax raises the price of future consumption by 27\%,   
from 0.3751 to and 0.4776.  


If people consume more now and less later, then 
they are saving less. 
And if they are saving less, 
the economy will have less capital.  
The cost has the same source as our earlier analysis:
the private benefits of saving are less than the social benefits, 
so we do too little of it.
That's why some economists favor a consumption tax:  a tax on only 
that part of income that is consumed.  
In practice, many countries offer something of this sort 
through tax-sheltered retirement and saving programs.  


\subsubsection*{Applications}

Tax issues come up all the time.  Here are some examples, 
with some analysis added.  

Changing tax rates.  
Nobel-prize-winner Edward Prescott writes 
({\it Wall Street Journal\/}, December 20, 2005):  
\begin{quote}
Let's drop the word ``cuts'' [when we talk about taxes].  The problem with advocating a cut in something is that you are necessarily going to stir up political trouble from someone who will want to increase it again.  So, even if you are fortunate enough to get your cut enacted, it is likely a matter of time before the political pendulum swings back and someone else gets their increase.  And so we got the Reagan tax cuts, the Clinton tax hikes, the Bush temporary tax cuts and ... who knows what is next? In the meantime, taxpayers are left to wonder and worry what the next tax package will look like, and they are forced to scurry and scheme to take advantage of a current law or to avoid the penalties of the next.  Or vice versa.  This is no way for a government to treat its citizens.  
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{Executive summary}

\begin{enumerate}


\item All taxes have incentive effects.  In the absence of externalities and monopolies, the tax
systems that lead to the most efficient allocation of resources 
(i)~have low rates on a broad base, 
(ii)~tax products with inelastic demand, 
and (iii)~avoid taxing intermediate products.  

\item Taxing labor doesn't necessarily reduce work:  
it depends on the balance of income and substitution effects.  

\end{enumerate}


%\begin{comment}
\subsubsection*{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item  Suppose a hypothetical government has no expenditures to finance.  What tax rates should it
set?

Answer.  Zero!  Why?  Nonzero taxes (even negative taxes, or subsidies) generate adverse incentives: the prices people pay for products 
do not reflect their social cost of production.  
Possible exception:
externalities, although even here there may be better choices than taxes.

\item  Is small government best?

Answer.  This is a complex issue, but here's one take on it.  First,
you need a government. There are clearly important and necessary
roles for government: providing national and personal security,
defining and enforcing property rights, supporting competitive
markets, and so on. Without an effective government, you simply
can't have a productive economic system. Second, there's tremendous
variety across countries in the kinds of services provided by 
government. 
In many countries, governments supply educational
services, social insurance, and pensions, although the degree of
government involvement varies. The evidence is mixed.  Among 
countries with high GDP per person, those with large governments are
not noticeably less productive than those with small governments.
Sweden, for example, is a prosperous country despite very high
government spending. Among developing countries, the evidence is
stronger: those with smaller ratios of spending to GDP grew faster,
on average, over the last forty years. This may reflect the direct
effects of government or other factors, it's hard to say.

\item Comment on the efficacy of these aspects of the US tax system:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sales tax exemption for food and clothing. \\
Answer. ??
\item Sales tax exemption for goods purchased over the internet.
\item Sales tax exemption for medical care.  
\item Income tax exemption for health insurance.  
\item Sales tax exemption for education supplied by nonprofit institutions.  
\item Immediate elimination of the capital gains tax.  

Answer.  To the extent that it's a tax on investment income, 
this could be a good thing, as we've seen.    
Many experts think we should tax consumption instead. 
A second argument is that capital gains reflect inflation 
as well as investment income, 
which results in potentially very high rates on real returns.
The solution here, though, is to index the the tax system.  

An important caveat is that there are no adverse incentive effects
involved in taxing capital gains that have already been ...
The incentive argument only going forward.

\subsubsection*{Government purchases}

Government purchases of goods and services use resources:  if the government purchases more, then
unless there is a comparable increase in production there will be less available for consumption
and investment.  The primary effect is almost certainly to reduce the quantity of resources
available for other purposes, but beyond that the impact will depend on the type of government
purchase and specific features of the economic system.

Government purchases cover a wide range.  They include spending on the judicial system, public
education, health and medical services, transportation and telecommunication infrastructure, and
national security. Some of these expenditures raise the productivity of firms (eg, highways),
others provide utility to consumers (health services), and still others may do neither or both.
Some purchases compete with privately produced services (education) while others do not (national
security).

Let us consider, in the interest of concreteness, an increase in government purchases of goods and
services that neither increase the productivity of firms nor substitute for private consumption.
Let us assume, in addition, that the increase is financed by a comparable increase in lump-sum
taxes.  What is the impact on output, employment, consumption, investment, and interest rates?

There are many answers to this question, but what follows is a summary of our current
understanding of the issues.
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Output rises, but by less than the increase in government purchases.  In the Keynesian
models that you many of you studied as undergraduates, output rises because the economy has excess
capacity, and government spending acts as a catalyst.  But those models often suggest
``multiplier'' effects that lead to larger increases in output than government purchases. Modern
dynamic models operate through labor supply (see below) and typically imply small output effects.

\item Consumption and investment fall.  You might have guessed this from the output effect: since
$G$ rises by more than $Y$, there is less left for $C$ and $I$ (see:  expenditure identity). We're
ignoring international trade here, but will come back to it later in the course.

\item Employment rises.  This is the reason output rises (more people are working), but why?  In
Keynesian models we're simply jump-starting the economy.  In modern dynamic models, the increase
in government purchases reduces household's lifetime income (remember, their taxes went up, too).
This income effect leads them to work more (they buy less leisure).  The longer the increase in
spending lasts, the larger the impact on lifetime income and the greater the impact on labor
supply.  In most models the impact is relatively small in any case.  If the increase in spending
lasts a long time, the impact on employment (and output) is reduced further by a reduction in the
capital stock, which reduces the demand for labor.

\item Interest rates.  If the increase is temporary, then we expect consumption to increase in the
future (rebound) and hence for the interest rate to rise now, before returning to its current
level when the spending stops.  If the increase is permanent, consumption drops immediately and
the interest rate doesn't change.

\end{itemize}

These are claims of theory, but are the conclusions reasonable?  A number of kinds of evidence
suggest they are.  First, we have periodic wars. Wars are natural experiments, because they
increase government purchases sharply. In the US, for example, all of these features apply to
World War I, World War II, and the Korean War.  (Later wars were too small relative to the size of
the economy to have a noticeable impact.) Note, in particular, the evidence for WW II, which many
observers have credited with getting the country out of the Depression. (Robert Barro's {\it
Macroeconomics\/} has a nice summary of this evidence if you're interested in the details.)
Second, we can compare differences in the performance of countries with different levels of
government purchases.  The evidence for a broad cross-section of countries is that those with high
spending have lower growth rates and (eventually) lower output. Whether this reflects the
mechanism we've described or something else is a matter for debate, but the simple Keynesian
prediction that high levels of spending will be associated with high levels of output is simply
not a feature of the data.



\subsubsection*{Debt and deficits}

We're going to treat debt and deficits as promises to collect taxes in the future. The question is
whether the timing of taxes affects the economy.

Let us consider a drop in current tax revenue that increases the current deficit.  The government
budget constraint implies
\[
    B_t \;=\; (T_t - G_t - V_t)/(1+r_t) + B_{t+1}/(1+r_t) .
\]
If we substitute for the last term using the same equation at $t+1$, we get
\begin{eqnarray*}
    B_t &=& (T_t - G_t - V_t)/(1+r_t)
        + (T_{t+1} - G_{t+1} - V_{t+1})/[(1+r_t)(1+r_{t+1})] \\
        && + \; B_{t+2}/[(1+r_t)(1+r_{t+1})] .
\end{eqnarray*}
If we do this over and over again, and assume that the debt doesn't explode (we're making a
technical assumption that guarantees convergence), we find that the value of the current debt
equals the present discounted value of future surpluses:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    B_t &=&  (T_t - G_t - V_t)/(1+r_t) + (T_{t+1} - G_{t+1} - V_{t+1})/[(1+r_t)(1+r_{t+1})] \cdots \\
        &=&  \sum_{s=0}^\infty R_{t,t+s} (T_{t+s} - G_{t+s} - V_{t+s}) ,
\end{eqnarray*}
where
\[
    R_{t,t+s} \;=\; 1/[(1+r_t) (1+r_{t+1}) \cdots (1+r_{t+s})]
\]
is the discount factor applied at date $t$ to cash flows at $t+s$.  In words:  the debt is the
present value of future (primary) surpluses.  If we do something that changes the current deficit,
we must increase a future surplus to match.
