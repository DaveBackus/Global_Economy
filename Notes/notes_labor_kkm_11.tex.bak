\subsubsection*{Labor market indicators}

The most important labor market indicators are those describing
the labor market status of the population. The {\it population\/}
is a count of the total number of people. Strangely enough, it's
an estimate: we don't know exactly how many people there are in
the US, in Canada, or in China, but statistical agencies come up
with estimates by a number of methods, typically based on surveys.
For most labor market statistics, the starting point is the
adult population.
An adult may be (i)~employed (has a job), (ii)~unemployed (not
working but would like to), and (iii)~not in the labor force
(everyone else).
Category (ii)~is a little fuzzy:  how do we know whether or not
you would like to work? In some countries the answer comes from a
survey: we ask the person whether he or she is actively looking
for a job. In others only people claiming unemployment benefits
are classified as such.


Information on the labor market status of individuals leads to the
elaboration of statistics such as the {\it labor force\/}, the
{\it participation rate\/}, and the {\it unemployment rate\/}. The
labor force is the total number of people in categories (i) and
(ii): either working or wanting to work. The participation rate is
the ratio of the labor force to the adult population.
The unemployment rate is the ratio of the number of people who are unemployed to the labor force.


In the US, employment data are collected and reported monthly by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS releases its
closely-watched monthly report, ``The Current Situation,'' at
8:30 am on the first Friday of the month.  It includes such
indicators as employment (``nonfarm payroll''),
the unemployment rate, the size of the labor force,
and so on.  This release is based on two surveys, the Current
Employment Statistics (CES) survey of payroll records of firms and
the Current Population Survey (CPS) of households. The CES covers
300,000+ businesses and provides detailed industry data on
employment, hours, and earnings of workers on non-farm payrolls.
The CPS covers 60,000+ households sampled from the entire population in the U.S. and is conducted for the BLS by
the Bureau of the Census. It provides a comprehensive body of data
on labor force status:  employment, unemployment, and so on. The unemployment rate is one of the headline numbers from the monthly report. To measure the unemployment rate they ask (many) basic questions trying to elicit from people if they meet a \emph{very specific criteria} for being unemployed: if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior 4 weeks, and are currently available for work.\footnote{Note the definition of being unemployed has nothing to do with the collection of unemployment benefits. The CPS samples the entire population and defines unemployment as a condition that has noting to do with receiving benefits or not. Many pundits like to claim receiving benefits has something to do with these statistics---they don't, these talking heads are just plain wrong. } They ask other questions as well and report statistics about people who they call ``discouraged workers'' and ``marginally attached.'' These categories are broader than being unemployed and provide an additional gauge about the slack (or lack thereof) in the labor market. Finally, note that both sets of data from the CPS and CES are updated periodically as more information comes
in.  Since the two sources are radically different,
they occasionally result in conflicting information about such
basic indicators as the number of people employed.

Many countries also collect data on changes in job market status
from one month to the next, generally termed {\it labor market
flows\/}. In a typical case, the categories are expanded as
follows: (ia)~employed in same job as last period, (ib)~employed
in different job, (ii)~unemployed, and (iii)~not in labor force.
Related information is collected from firms.  A firm is said to
create jobs if it lists more positions (filled or not) than in the
previous period and destroy jobs if there are fewer.  Total {\it
job creation\/} for the economy as a whole is the total number of
positions added by firms that create jobs.  Similarly, total {\it
job destruction\/} is the total number of positions lost by firms
that destroy jobs.  The astonishing feature of flow data is how
much churning goes on: millions of people gain and lose jobs every
month, and millions of jobs are created and destroyed, whether the
economy is growing or shrinking.


\subsubsection*{Supply and demand analysis of the labor market}

Differences in the abilities and skills of individuals
make labor markets incredibly complex,
but we can get a sense of the impact of government regulation
in a model in which there is a single market for a single kind of labor.


\bigskip
{\it The demand for labor}

The demand for labor comes from (typically) firms,
whose decision-making process works something like this.
Consider a firm that produces output using the production function
$Y=F(K,L)=AK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}$ (``Cobb-Douglas''). Let us say,
in the interest of keeping things as simple as possible, that the
capital stock is some fixed number $K$. How does the firm's profit
depend on the choice of labor input $L$? If $p$ is the price of
one unit of output and $w$ is the price (wage) of one unit of
labor (here the unit may be one hour), the firm's profit is
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \mbox{Profit} &=& p Y - w L - \mbox{Fixed Costs} \\
                  &=& p F(K,L) - w L - \mbox{Fixed Costs} .
\end{eqnarray*}
%
How does profit vary with $L$? The fixed costs might be attributed
to capital or other factors, but they do not vary with $L$.
For this reason they won't affect the demand for labor.  What is
affected by $L$ is output (which in turn affects sales revenue)
and cost (the wage bill).

\begin{comment}
If we increase labor by an amount $\Delta L$, the increase in output
is
%
\[
    \Delta Y  \;=\; F(K,L+\Delta L)-F(K,L)
        \;=\; \frac{F(K,L+\Delta L)-F(K,L)}{\Delta L}\Delta L.
\]
%
When $\Delta L$ is small, this is a derivative:
%
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta Y  \;\approx\; \frac{\partial F(K,L)}{\partial L}\Delta L.
\end{equation*}
%
(See the ``Mathematics Review'' if this seems overly mysterious.)
The increase in revenue is therefore $p\times \Delta Y = p \times
[\partial F(K,L)/\partial L] \Delta L$. What is the increase in
cost from the same increase $\Delta L$? Simply $w\Delta L$.
\end{comment}

If the firm maximizes its profit, it will equate the increase in
revenue associated with hiring an extra unit of labor to the
increase in cost. That is, it will add labor as long as the marginal
benefit is greater than the marginal cost. We have learned earlier
that we can characterize the solution to the firm's maximization
problem my looking at the first order conditions.  The first order
condition for this problem is found by computing the derivative of
the profit function with respect to $L$ and setting it equal to
zero.  After rearranging the terms we have that maximum profit
occurs when the marginal benefit of labor is equal to its marginal
cost:
%
\[
    p \; \frac{\partial F(K,L)}{\partial L} \;=\; w .
\]
%
This is an equation we can solve for $L$ and represents the amount
of labor the firm will hire (demand) for any given values of $p$,
$w$, and $K$.  In the Cobb-Douglas case, $ Y = A K^\alpha
L^{1-\alpha}$ and the demand function follows from
%
\begin{equation*}
    p (1-\alpha) A K^{\alpha}L^{-\alpha} \;=\; w ,
\end{equation*}
%
which implies (solve for $L$)
%
\begin{equation}
    L \;=\; K\left[\frac{ p (1-\alpha) A}{w}\right]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}.
    \label{eq:ld}
\end{equation}
%
The aggregate (total) demand for labor is the sum of demands
across all firms. Its important feature, for our purposes, is that
it falls when the wage rises, just as we assume most demand
functions do. (This property follows from the diminishing marginal
productivity of labor, one of the conditions we imposed on the
production function.)

\bigskip
{\it The supply of labor}

Now let's turn to the supply of labor. The short version: supply
increases with the wage.
A more complete version goes like this.
When selling their labor services, individuals
make two decisions: whether to work at all and, if so, how much to
work.  Obviously, many jobs offer limited flexibility on the
second dimension.  For this reason, and also because it simplifies
the analysis, we will ignore the second choice and consider the
decision of an individual deciding whether or not to work a given
number of hours $h$.  What is the gain from working? The pecuniary
gain is $wh$. However, what matters for the individual is the
increase in happiness, or satisfaction, that such pay induces.
This may vary across individuals.  For example, the same pay may
be more valuable to a poor individual than to a rich one. What is
the loss from working? Simple!  He has less time to dedicate to
other activities, including playing bridge or football, cooking
elaborate meals, and spending time with family. The value of these
activities is what economists call the \textit{reservation wage}.
For any wage less than this, the benefits of not working are
greater than the benefits of working. For the economy as a whole,
the higher the wage, the greater the number of people
who decide to work.
Thus aggregate labor supply $L^{s}$ increases with the wage rate
$w$.

\bigskip
{\it Labor market equilibrium}

The equilibrium wage rate is a value $w^{*}$ at which demand and
supply are equal, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:equilibrium}.
The number of workers employed at this wage defines the level of
employment $L^{*}$. This kind of analysis should be familiar to
anyone who has taken an economics course.

\bigskip
{\it Unemployment and distortions}

We can now return to the issue we raised earlier:  unemployment.
Where is unemployment in our supply-and-demand analysis of the
labor market?  In Figure~\ref{fig:equilibrium}, we might think of
$L^*$ as representing both employment (the number of people hired
by firms, since the point is on their demand curve) and the labor
force (the number of people who want to work at the going wage).
Unemployment is the difference between these two numbers, so
evidently there is none.  There is an almost perfect analogy
between this market and a dealer-type securities market such as
the Nasdaq.  At the Nasdaq, dealers post bid and ask prices and
are committed to executing transactions at those prices. If you
want to sell a given security, you just contact one of them (or
ask your broker to do this for you).  If you'd like to sell at
less than the bid, you have a deal.  There are no ``unemployed''
securities.

%If the labor market worked this way, individuals would post their
%reservation wage.  If it were low enough, some firm would hit
%itThere could not be unemployment, simply because any person
%willing to work would be able to do so, simply by lowering the
%reservation wage enough.

There are many reasons labor markets don't work this way,
but economists generally agree that government policies and institutions
play a role.
Examples include minimum wages, restrictions on wage adjustments, labor unions, limits on hiring and firing, and so on.
We don't argue that these things are bad --- they may very
well have benefits --- but they do have an impact on how the labor
market works.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The minimum wage is the simplest distortion to study.  If we
prohibit purchases of labor services below a given wage, how does
the market operate?
Figure~\ref{fig:minimum} shows how the supply-and-demand analysis
might be applied in this case.  In the figure, the minimum wage
($w_{m}$) is higher than the equilibrium wage ($w^{*}$) in the
absence of distortions.  At the minimum wage, the supply of labor
(the labor force) is $L^{s}(w_{m})$, which is higher than the
demand $L^{d}(w_{m})$.  Minimum wage laws don't force firms to
hire, so employment is given by their demand function:
$L^{d}(w_{m})$.  The difference between supply and demand is
unemployment:  $L^{s}(w_{m})-L^{d}(w_{m})$ people would like to
work at the wage $w_{m}$ but do not.  The unemployment rate is
therefore $ [L^{s}(w_{m})-L^{d}(w_{m})]/L^{s}(w_{m})$.  As a
practical matter, it's an open question whether the impact of the
minimum wage on unemployment is large or small, but few economists
doubt that it's there.
This analysis also gives you an idea of the political calculations
behind such policies.
The beneficiaries are the employed,
who get a higher wage than they would otherwise.
Who loses?  The unemployed.

The minimum wage is a useful (and simple) illustration,
but labor market institutions and regulations
differ dramatically across countries along many dimensions.
Other important differences include labor unions (who favor members over non-members) and
restrictions on separations and mandatory severance payments (which favor current job-holders
over future job-holders).
In the academic world, tenure is an example of an institution
that affects employment.


\subsubsection*{Job creation and destruction}

Modern economies create and destroy jobs (positions) at very high
rates.  We see this in data from both firms and households.
At firms, new positions are created either because existing firms
expand their operations or because new firms hire workers. We
refer to this phenomenon as \textit{job creation}. At the same
time, existing firms sometimes eliminate positions.  We refer to
this process as \textit{job destruction}.  An establishment (a
production unit, like a factory, or a store) is said to create
jobs if it increases the number of positions between one period
and the next.  The economy's overall job creation is the sum of
the increases in positions across all the establishments that
created jobs.  Similarly, an establishment is said to destroy jobs
when it decreases its number of positions from one period to the
next. The economy's overall job destruction is the sum of the
decreases in jobs across all establishments that destroyed jobs.
The sum of job creation and job destruction is referred to as
\textit{job reallocation} or \textit{job turnover}. Job creation,
destruction, and reallocation \textit{rates} are simply ratios of
job creation, destruction, and reallocation, respectively, to the
total number of jobs in the economy. These rates vary greatly
across countries, but their magnitudes are impressive everywhere.
In the US in 1988,
the annual job creation rate in manufacturing
was 8.3\%. The job destruction rate was about the same. Therefore
job reallocation amounted to a staggering 16.7\% a year. For the
US economy as a whole, job creation and destruction rates were
13.0\% and 10.4\%, respectively, over the same period.

We see similar turnover in household data,
with individuals reporting frequent changes in jobs
or employment status.
An employed individual can either stay in her job, move to another
job, become unemployed (leave one job but look for another), or
leave the labor force (leave one job without wanting another).
Similarly, an unemployed person can become employed (get a job),
stay unemployed (look for a job without taking one), or leave the
labor force (stop looking for a job).  Someone out of the labor
force can become employed (take a job), become unemployed (look
for a job without taking one), or remain out of the labor force.
We have information from surveys on each of these possible
changes.

Some summary measures will give you a sense of how this looks for
a typical individual.  {\it Accessions\/} occur when individuals
take new jobs, regardless of their current status. {\it
Separations\/} occur when individuals leave jobs, regardless of
reason. The accession and separation {\it rates\/} are ratios of
accessions and separations, respectively, to total jobs.  The sum
of the two rates is referred to as the \textit{worker reallocation
rate}. In the late 1980s, the annual accession rate in the US was
45.2\% and the annual separation rate was 46.0\%.  The worker
reallocation rate was a staggering 91.2\%! These numbers do not
say why workers change jobs, merely that they do. The numbers for
the US are unusually high.  Worker reallocation rates are
generally lower in other countries, including France (59.6\%) and
Italy (68.1\%). Apparently in the US it is more common both to
leave a job and to take a new job.
You might ask yourself whether the factors that make the separation rate
high also make the accession rate high, or whether they are
influenced by different factors.

You might ask how U.S. accessions and separations have evolved since
the Great Recession began in 2007. The answer is that both have declined sharply
and remained at depressed levels even two years after the recession ended in 2009.
While job openings have picked up a bit since bottoming in 2009, hires have not,
indicating some mix of business caution, diminished labor supply, and increased
mismatch between labor supply and demand. Rising vacancies relative to employment raise the question whether the U.S. labor market has become less flexible than
in the past, and more like labor markets in Europe.

\begin{comment}
Fine points (feel free to skip). Part of worker reallocation is induced by job
reallocation. That is, when a job is created, there is always an
accession and when a job is destroyed there is always a
separation. The opposite, however is not true. Accessions can
occur without a new job being created and separations can occur
without a job being destroyed. This happens whenever a company
substitutes a worker for another one in exactly the same position.
The excess of worker reallocation over job reallocation is called \textit{excess worker reallocation}.
\end{comment}


\subsubsection*{A model of unemployment dynamics}

These flows suggest a more dynamic labor market than our supply-and-demand
analysis.
Where do they come from?
You might consider your own case:
what factors might cause you to leave a job?   take a new one?
We'll look at a simple model that helps us to understand the overall
impact of individual decisions like this on economy-wide
employment and unemployment rates.
To keep things simple, we will ignore transitions in and out of the labor
force and focus on employment and unemployment.


To start, individuals may be either unemployed, $U$, or employed, $E$, with $U+E={L}$ and $L$ a fixed number.
The unemployment and employment rates are then $u=U/{L}$ and $e=E/{L}$.
Since the only states are $U$ and $E$, the employment and unemployment rates sum to one:
$ u+e=1$. (Careful: this is not usually the case in the data; why don't unemployment and employment rates usually sum to 1?)

The unemployment rate can change over time if individuals
change their labor market status.
Let us say that a constant fraction $0<s<1$ ($s$ for separation)
of employed people lose
their jobs and become unemployed.
Why might this be?  Perhaps because their firms are doing poorly,
and either shrink or go out of business altogether.
Let us also say that a constant fraction $0<a<1$ ($a$ for accession) of
unemployed people find new jobs, as they find employers who need their skills.
We've seen that this kind of reallocation is the norm for modern economies.
With these two ingredients, the unemployment rate changes like this
from one period to the next:
\begin{equation*}
    u_{t+1} \;=\; u_{t}+se_t-au_t
\end{equation*}
or
\[
    \Delta u_{t+1} \;=\; se_t-au_t .
\]
Unemployment rises over time if more employed people lose their jobs than unemployed people find new jobs, and falls over time if the reverse is true. (Formally, this should remind you of the dynamics of capital accumulation in the Solow growth model).
Since $u_t+e_t=1$, we can write this as
\begin{equation}
    \Delta u_{t+1} \;=\; s (1-u_{t})-a u_{t}
    \label{eq:u-dyns}
\end{equation}
This is useful because we have summarized the dynamics of unemployment in a single equation. If you were told that the unemployment rate was now (say)  $u_{0}$, then repeated application of (\ref{eq:u-dyns}) would enable you to calculate the unemployment rate in future periods. It would be a very simple matter to do these calculations in Excel.

Using equation (\ref{eq:u-dyns}) we can compute
both the period-by-period dynamics and the steady state unemployment rate.
We find steady state unemployment ($\overline{u}$, say) by setting $\Delta u_{t+1}=0$ so that
\[0=s(1-\overline{u})-a\overline{u}\]
Solving for $\overline{u}$ gives
\[
    \overline{u} \;=\; \frac{s}{s+a} ,
\]
a number between zero and one. Over time, the unemployment rate ``gravitates'' to this value, so we might also refer to it as the ``long run'' or ``natural'' unemployment rate.
The idea is that we want a measure of the underlying unemployment rate that would prevail if it were not for temporary shocks that make $u_0\ne\overline{u}$.
Clearly, steady state unemployment is higher when $s$, the separation rate, is higher and is lower when $a$, the accession rate, is higher. That is, if people lose jobs easily and have difficulty finding them then the unemployment rate will be higher.

You should think of the parameters of this model, $a$ and $s$, as standing in for various country-specific labor market policies and institutional arrangements that affect the willingness of firms to hire and fire workers, the willingness of workers to take and quit jobs, and so on.
Examples of such policies include: minimum wages,
taxes on labor income, regulations that control the length of the working week (such as the 35 hour week in France), the size of severance payments for layoffs, the size of unemployment benefits, and so on. Which of these policies decrease $a$? Which of these policies decrease $s$?

Here is a different way to look at the steady state calculation. With a little bit of statistics, one can show that an individual's average duration of unemployment in this model is $1/a$ and an individual's average duration of employment is $1/s$. Steady state unemployment is given by
\[\overline{u} = \frac{s}{s+a} = \frac{\frac{1}{a}}{\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{s}}=\frac{\textmd{duration of  $U$}}{\textmd{duration of $U$ + duration of $E$}}
\]
So, to think about why European unemployment is relatively high when compared to the US, we might begin with factors that either increase the duration of unemployment or reduce the duration of employment. Which of these factors do you think is more important for European unemployment?


\subsubsection*{Virtues of flexible labor markets}

There's a big-picture point hidden here.
In a dynamic economy, the mix of products is changing constantly.
Many of the products and services we use today
simply weren't available twenty years ago:
high-speed internet access, iPods, databases, and so on.
A successful economy needs a mechanism to shift
capital and labor to the new uses demanded by consumers.
The evidence suggests that countries with capital markets
that do this well tend to perform well in the aggregate.
Similarly, there is ample data
showing that the ability of an economy to reallocate jobs across
firms, industries, and geographical areas, as well as the ability
to reallocate workers, is critical to its success.
%In modern economies, the first shift was from agriculture to manufacturing.
%Now we're going through a similar shift from manufacturing to services.
Sometimes labor
market institutions are an obstacle to this reallocation process,
and can have unwanted negative effects on macroeconomic
performance.

We can get a sense of these dynamics from our labor market analysis.
In our model, the accession and separation rates also govern the response of the unemployment rate to a shock that pushes unemployment above (or below) its steady state value. In particular, these rates govern the {\it speed of adjustment} back to steady state. To see this, write the equation governing the dynamics of the unemployment rate as
\[
    u_{t+1} \;=\; s+ [1-(s+a)] u_{t} .
\]
In order for the model to be empirically realistic, we need a worker reallocation rate, $s+a$, that satisfies
\[0<s+a<1\]
With a little bit of algebra, the unemployment rate can be written in terms of deviations from its steady state value
\[
    u_{t+1}-\overline{u} \;=\; \lambda (u_t-\overline{u}) ,
\]
where $\lambda=1-(s+a)$ is the speed of adjustment of the unemployment rate to its steady state value. The reason for this name is that with a little bit more algebra one can show that if the unemployment rate is hit by a temporary shock (that does not affect $a$ or $s$) so that it takes on the value $u_0$, the adjustment back to steady state is given by the formula
\[
    u_t-\overline{u} \;=\; \lambda^{t}(u_0-\overline{u})
\]
or
\[
    u_t \;=\; (1-\lambda^{t})\overline{u}+\lambda^{t}u_0 .
\]
What's important is not the algebra but the idea:
in economies with low values of $s$ and $a$,
worker reallocation is slow.
Here we see that this results in slow adjustment of the unemployment rate.
But you can imagine, as well, slow reaction of producers to consumer
preferences.
The churning of the labor market implied by high values of $s$ and $a$
thus serves a purpose:  it shifts workers to jobs where their value is the highest.



\begin{comment}
Notice that a high separation rate $s$ has two important effects on the economy: it (i)~raises the steady state unemployment rate, but (ii) helps the economy respond quickly to temporary shocks to unemployment. On the other hand, a high accession rate $a$ has two unambiguously good effects: it (i) reduces the steady state unemployment rate, and (ii) helps the economy respond quickly to temporary shocks. This suggests that one way to think about the European unemployment problem is as an economy with an $s$ that is moderate and an $a$ that is low.
\end{comment}

Numerical example.
%Because we have ignored transitions out of the labor force, these numbers %can't be realistic.
Suppose in both Europe and the US, $s=0.01$, and that in the US accession is $a_{US}=0.19$ but lower in Europe, $a_{EU}=0.09$. Then not only is European unemployment 10\% as opposed to 5\% in the US, but European unemployment takes considerably longer to respond to shocks than does the US ($\lambda_{EU}=0.90,\lambda_{US}=0.80$). Based on this example, can you imagine the economic consequences if, as recent evidence hints, the U.S. labor market has become less flexible?

%What about the role of excess worker reallocation? When a new
%match between a firm and a worker is formed, the former knows
%little about the latter, and vice-versa. In many instances, they

\subsubsection*{Jobs, technology, and deregulation}

Let's consider a second perspective on labor market flexibility.
Should we be concerned if labor-saving technological change leads some people to lose their jobs?  These concerns are not new;
they date back at least to the machine-smashing ``Luddites'' who worried that technological (and organizational) change during the industrial revolution threatened their jobs.
The answer is that we might very well be concerned, but we should also realize that labor-saving technological change is a good thing for the economy as a whole.
Why?  Because we can shift workers to jobs that have greater value.

We illustrate the argument in a model that is
simple (simple-minded?) in all other respects.
Suppose people consume two kinds of products,
manufactures and services ($C_M$ and $C_S$), and do so in equal proportions
\[
    C_M \;=\; C_S
\]

Now suppose that manufactures and services are each produced according to a production function using labor as the only input (we ignore capital for simplicity). These production functions are
\begin{eqnarray*}
    Y_M &=& A_M L_M\\
    Y_S &=& A_S L_S .
\end{eqnarray*}
Here, $A_M$ and $A_S$ are TFP in manufacturing and services, which may be different. The economy has a fixed total supply of labor $\overline{L}$ which can be used for producing either manufactures or services:
\[
    L_M+L_S \;=\; \overline{L} .
\]
To finish the model, we require that people cannot consume more than what is produced of each of manufactures and services:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    C_M &=& Y_M\\
C_S &=& Y_S .
\end{eqnarray*}
The parameters of this model are the productivities, $A_M$ and $A_S$, and the labor supply, $\overline{L}$.


What is the allocation of labor?  It should be clear that once we know the labor employed in each sector, it's easy to determine output and consumption. After a little bit of algebra, we get the labor used in each sector of the economy as
\begin{eqnarray*}
    L_M &=& \frac{A_S}{A_M+A_S}\overline{L}\\
    L_S &=& \frac{A_M}{A_M+A_S}\overline{L}
\end{eqnarray*}
Each sector uses a fixed fraction of the total labor force $\overline{L}$,
with the fractions determined by the productivities.
For example, if $\overline{L}=150$ workers and we start with $A_M=A_S=2$, then employment in each sector is $L_M = L_S = 75$ workers and consumption is $C_M=C_S=150$.


The question is what happens when we have technological progress,
which increases productivity in one or both sectors.
Let's begin with the case of {\it neutral\/} technological change. Suppose both $A_M$ and $A_S$ double. Then employment shares in each sector of the economy would not change, both sectors would still employ 75 workers,
and production and consumption would double to $C_M=C_S=300$.
This is kind of technological change is clearly a ``good thing''.

What people tend to be worried about is {\it biased\/} technological change that affects one sector of the economy more than another. As an example, suppose that manufacturing productivity doubles from $A_M=2$ to $A_M=4$ while services productivity is unchanged at $A_S=2$. Then employment in manufacturing falls from $L_M=75$ to $L_M = 50$. This seems like a disaster, 33\% of manufacturing jobs have been lost! But employment in services rises from  $L_S=75$ to $L_S=100$, an employment {\it gain} of 33\%!
More than that, overall production and consumption rise from $C_M=C_S=150$ to $C_M=C_S=200$. Obviously, when productivity in manufacturing is higher, the economy can produce more things and this makes consumers better off.
If an analyst had only looked at manufacturing, they might conclude that productivity growth was bad for the economy. But this would be committing a \textit{fallacy of composition}: what's bad (or good) for one firm or one sector of the economy is not necessarily bad for the overall economy.
%A very nice article by Paul Krugman, %``\href{http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~cedmond/gbe2/KrugmanAT.pdf}{The Accidental %Theorist}'' uses precisely this model to also make a number of points about %the value of simple models and their use in making sure our arguments hang %together.

As another example of this kind of reasoning, ask yourself: why is employment in agriculture such a small fraction of total US employment? Mainly, it is because US agriculture is so productive that it takes only a small number of workers to produce all the agricultural goods that the US economy needs. In the {\it long run}, this is unambiguously a good thing for the US economy: it releases scarce labor resources to produce other kinds of goods. Think of all the kinds of products that could not be made if US agricultural productivity was not so good and the economy had to allocate many more workers to that sector in order to make sure that people have enough to eat.
In fact, one of the issues most developing countries face is how to
accomodate this transition.
Most countries subsidize agriculture (even the US!),
thereby resisting the reallocation of labor that would otherwise
increase the productivity of the economy as a whole.


Why might they do that?  The key is the weasel words {\it long run} used above. You should be asking: what about unemployment? This model has no unemployed workers. Obviously, in the transition to relatively low employment in manufacturing and relatively high employment in services, some people are going to be unemployed. Unemployed workers are something we would like to avoid. But if labor markets function well, then the costs of reallocating workers from manufacturing to services need not be too severe. In terms of the model of unemployment dynamics that we looked at above, we need $s+a$ to be high --- and preferably because $a$ is high so that long run unemployment $\overline{u}$ is not too severe. Put differently, steady state unemployment is determined by the kinds of frictions that influence the accession and separation rates in our earlier model of worker flows and not by cross-sectional differences in productivity. If technological change throws people out of work in manufacturing, there will be a temporary increase in unemployment. But over time, these people will tend to be reabsorbed into employment. The higher is the accession rate $a$, the faster (and less costly for the unfortunate workers and their families) will be the transition.

As a final remark, it is also possible to design efficient compensation schemes that assist workers through an unemployment spell. Why might such assistance be necessary? One important reason is that our model treated workers in manufacturing and services as identical, but in reality it is likely that manufacturing workers have a lot of job-specific skills that may not be so easily applied in the services sector. Such workers may need assistance to retrain for work in the services sector. Compensation schemes like this, in addition to a fluid labor market, are another way that the transitional costs of reallocating workers from manufacturing to services can be made as small as possible.


Deregulation is similar, in the sense that it often leads to reallocation of capital and labor.  Consider an example from Europe. In recent years, the European
airline market has gone through a deregulation process that
resembles the one that characterized the US in the 1980s. Before
deregulation, every European country had its own national airline.
The airline was typically a monopolist on internal routes, and a
(collusive) duopolist (with the other country's airline) on
international routes.  Like most monopolists, these airlines
charged high fares and operated inefficiently.  Now any company
can fly any route in the European Union. The entry of new carriers
has meant big trouble
for many of the incumbents. Sabena and Swissair went bust. Others
(Alitalia?) will probably follow suit. It is clear that at the end
of the reorganization of the industry, fares will be much lower
(they are already, as a matter of fact).
As a result, people will
fly more often and there will be more jobs in the industry. Along
the way, job destruction by the incumbents will be accompanied by
(probably greater) job creation by the new entrants.

Who gains? Consumers and workers in new firms. Who loses?
Incumbent firms' workers and shareholders.  Standard analysis of
the costs of monopoly tell us that the gains are greater than the
losses, but the political process does not necessarily weight them
equally. In fact, the costs will be {\it concentrated} while the benefits are often thinly {\it spread} over many individual consumers and firms. This explains why it can be hard to organize coalitions in favor of reform.

\subsubsection*{Executive summary}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Labor market indicators include employment (the number of
people working), unemployment (the number not working who would
like to), the labor force (employment plus unemployment), and the
unemployment rate (the ratio of unemployment to the labor force).

\item Measures to protect workers often have the opposite effect:
by making labor more expensive to firms, they reduce the demand
for labor and aggregate employment.

\item Many developed economies are characterized by high rates of job
and worker reallocation: people change jobs and firms change
workers --- frequently.

\item The efficiency of work reallocation affects the performance
of the economy as a whole. In particular, flexible labor markets help an economy respond quickly to changes in the economy.

%\item Labor-saving productivity is good:
%it allows us to choose between less work and more output.
%In practice, the main effect has been more output,
%which we get by reallocating labor across sectors.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item (Indicators). You are the mayor of a small village, whose
labor market data are: population (100), employment (55), and
unemployment (5).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a circle on a piece of paper corresponding to the
population of your village. Divide it into sections corresponding
to employment, unemployment, labor force, and not in the labor
force.

\item Compute the participation rate and the unemployment rate.
\end{enumerate}

Answer.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For you to do.

\item The participation rate is 60\% [$= (55+5)/100$] and the
unemployment rate is 8.3\% [$= 5/60$].
\end{enumerate}

\item (Unemployment dynamics). Suppose the accession rate is $a=0.2$ and the separation rate is $s=0.01$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the steady state unemployment rate and the speed of adjustment.
\item Suppose that a restriction on firing makes workers less attractive to firms. What effects might this have on long run unemployment and the response of the economy to unemployment shocks?
\end{enumerate}

Answer.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The steady state (long run) unemployment rate is $\overline{u} = s/(s+a) = 0.01/(0.01+0.20) = 0.048$ or 4.8\%. The speed of adjustment is $\lambda = 1 - (s+a) = 1 - (0.01+0.20) = 0.79$.
\item This restriction is likely to lower the accession rate $a$, thereby increasing long run unemployment and making unemployment shocks last longer (i.e., making $\lambda$ closer to one).
\end{enumerate}

\item (Supply and demand). Consider an economy with one firm (which
is nevertheless a price taker).  It produces widgets according to
the production function $Y = A K^{1/2}L^{1/2}$ and sells them for
2 dollars each.  For simplicity, assume that $A = K = 1$.  The
supply of labor in this economy is $L^{s}=w^{3/2}$.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the equilibrium values for the labor force, the
wage, and employment? What is the unemployment rate?

\item Suppose the government imposes a minimum wage of \$1.1. What
are the equilibrium values for the labor force, the wage, and
employment? What is the unemployment rate?
\end{enumerate}

Answer.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item The demand for labor is given by $L^{d}(w) = 1 [ 2 \times
(1/2)]/{w}]^{2} = w^{-2}$.  [This follows from the labor demand
function, equation (\ref{eq:ld})].  Equating demand and supply
yields $L^{*}=w^{*}=1$. The labor force is one and the
unemployment rate is zero.

\item With a minimum wage of \$1.1, the supply of labor (the labor
force) is $1.1^{{3}/{2}} = 1.15$. The demand for labor is
$1.1^{-2}=0.826$. Therefore employment is 0.826 and the
unemployment rate is $(1.15-0.826)/{1.15}= .2817$ or 28.17\%.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

OLD STUFF FROM SPRING 05
\bigskip
Economists think about the labor market much as they do about any
other market: as an interaction of buyers (demand) and sellers
(supply). The product they exchange is labor services.  The demand
side of the market consists (typically) of firms. The supply side
consists of individuals. The title of this document is plural
because there are many different types of labor services. Each of
them has its own market.

The central issue of this module is unemployment: what it is,
where it comes from. Unemployment is one of those things that
seems obvious until you think about it for a while. We say someone
is unemployed if someone would like to sell his or her labor
services at the market wage, but finds no buyer.  Why does this
happen with labor, but not with fruit or cars or other products?
What makes labor different? Our answer is that labor markets are
governed by more laws, regulations, and special institutions than
most other markets.


\subsubsection*{Labor market indicators}

The most important labor market indicators are those describing
the labor market status of the population. The {\it population\/}
is a count of the total number of people. Strangely enough, it's
an estimate: we don't know exactly how many people there are in
the US, in Canada, or in China, but statistical agencies come up
with estimates by a number of methods, typically based on surveys.
A person may be (i)~employed (has a job), (ii)~unemployed (not
working but would like to), and (iii)~not in the labor force
(everyone else). (ii)~is a little fuzzy:  how do we know whether
you would like to work? In some countries the answer comes from a
survey: we ask the person whether he or she is actively looking
for a job. In others only people claiming unemployment benefits
are classified as such.

Information on the labor market status of individuals leads to the
elaboration of statistics such as the {\it labor force\/}, the
{\it participation rate\/}, and the {\it unemployment rate\/}. The
labor force is the total number of people in categories (i) and
(ii): either working or wanting to work. The participation rate is
the ratio of the labor force to the population. In some countries,
this is computed using only the population of people of working
age, say 15 to 65; details vary. The unemployment rate is the
ratio of the number of people who are unemployed to the labor
force.

%Many countries also collect data on changes in job market status
%from one month to the next, generally termed {\it labor market
%flows\/}. In a typical case, the categories are expanded as
%follows: (ia)~employed in same job as last period, (ib)~employed
%in different job, (ii)~unemployed, and (iii)~not in labor force.
%Related information is collected from firms.  A firm is said to
%create jobs if it lists more positions (filled or not) than in the
%previous period and destroy jobs if there are fewer.  Total {\it
%job creation\/} for the economy as a whole is the total number of
%positions added by firms that create jobs.  Similarly, total {\it
%job destruction\/} is the total number of positions lost by firms
%that destroy jobs.  The astonishing feature of flow data is how
%much churning goes on: millions of people gain and lose jobs every
%month, and millions of jobs are created and destroyed, whether the
%economy is growing or shrinking.

In the US, employment data are collected and reported monthly by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The BLS releases its
closely-watched monthly report, ``The Current Situation,'' at
8:30am on the first Friday of the month.  It includes such
indicators as the unemployment rate, the size of the labor force,
and so on.  This release is based on two surveys, the Current
Employment Statistics (CES) survey of payroll records of firms and
the Current Population Survey (CPS) of households. The CES covers
300,000+ businesses and provides detailed industry data on
employment, hours, and earnings of workers on non-farm payrolls.
The CPS covers 60,000+ households and is conducted for the BLS by
the Bureau of the Census. It provides a comprehensive body of data
on labor force status:  employment, unemployment, and so on.  Both
sets of data are updated periodically as more information comes
in.  Since the two sources of information are radically different,
they occasionally result in conflicting information about such
basic indicators as the number of people employed.


\subsubsection*{The demand for labor}

Now that we have a sense of the data, we can start to think about
how labor markets work.  Our starting point is supply and demand.

Consider a firm that produces output using the production function
$Y=F(K,L)=AK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}$ (``Cobb-Douglas''). Let us say,
in the interest of keeping things as simple as possible, that the
capital stock is some fixed number $K$. How does the firm's profit
depend on the choice of labor input $L$? If $p$ is the price of
one unit of output and $w$ is the price (wage) of one unit of
labor (here the unit may be one hour), the firm's profit is
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \mbox{Profit} &=& p Y - w L - \mbox{Fixed Costs} \\
                  &=& p F(K,L) - w L - \mbox{Fixed Costs} .
\end{eqnarray*}
%
How does profit vary with $L$? The fixed costs might be attributed
to capital or other factors. In general they won't vary with $L$.
For this reason they won't affect the demand for labor. What is
affected by $L$ is output (which in turn affects sales revenue)
and cost (the wage bill). If we increase labor by an amount
$\Delta L$, the increase in output is
%
\[
    \Delta Y  \;=\; F(K,L+\Delta L)-F(K,L)
        \;=\; \frac{F(K,L+\Delta L)-F(K,L)}{\Delta L}\Delta L.
\]
%
When $\Delta L$ is small, this is a derivative:
%
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta Y  \;\approx\; \frac{\partial F(K,L)}{\partial L}\Delta L.
\end{equation*}
%
(See the ``Mathematics Review'' if this seems overly mysterious.)
The increase in revenue is therefore $p\times \Delta Y = p \times
[\partial F(K,L)/\partial L] \Delta L$. What is the increase in
cost from the same increase $\Delta L$? Simply $w\Delta L$.

If the firm maximizes its profit, it will equate the increase in
revenue to the increase in cost. That is, it will add labor as
long as the marginal benefit is greater than the marginal cost.  A
maximum occurs when the two are equal:
%
\[
    p \; \frac{\partial F(K,L)}{\partial L} \;=\; w .
\]
%
This is an equation we can solve for $L$ and represents the amount
of labor the firm will hire (demand) for any given values of $p$,
$w$, and $K$.  In the Cobb-Douglas case, $ Y = A K^\alpha
L^{1-\alpha}$ and the demand function follows from
%
\begin{equation*}
    p (1-\alpha) A K^{\alpha}L^{-\alpha} \;=\; w ,
\end{equation*}
%
which implies (solve for $L$)
%
\begin{equation}
    L \;=\; K\left[\frac{ p (1-\alpha) A}{w}\right]^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}.
    \label{eq:ld}
\end{equation}
%
The aggregate (total) demand for labor is the sum of demands
across all firms. Its important feature, for our purposes, is that
it falls when the wage rises, just as we assume most demand
functions do. (This property follows from the diminishing marginal
productivity of labor, one of the conditions we imposed on the
production function.)


\subsubsection*{The supply of labor}

Now let's turn to the supply of labor. The short version: supply
increases with the wage.

When selling their labor services on the marketplace, individuals
make two decisions: whether to work at all and, if so, how much to
work.  Obviously, many jobs offer limited flexibility on the
second dimension.  For this reason, and also because it simplifies
the analysis, we will ignore the second choice and consider the
decision of an individual deciding whether or not to work a given
number of hours $h$.  What is the gain from working? The pecuniary
gain is $wh$. However, what matters for the individual is the
increase in happiness, or satisfaction, that such pay induces.
This may vary across individuals.  For example, the same pay may
be more valuable to a poor individual than to a rich one. What is
the loss from working? Simple!  He has less time to dedicate to
other activities, including playing bridge or football, cooking
elaborate meals, and spending time with family. The value of these
activities is what economists call the \textit{reservation wage}.
For any wage less than this, the benefits of not working are
greater than the benefits of working. For the economy as a whole,
then, the higher the wage, the more people will decide to work.
Thus aggregate labor supply $L^{s}$ increases with the wage rate
$w$.

\subsubsection*{Labor market equilibrium}

The equilibrium wage rate is a value $w^{*}$ at which demand and
supply are equal, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:equilibrium}.

%
The number of workers employed at this wage defines the level of
employment $L^{*}$. This kind of analysis should be familiar to
anyone who has taken an economics course.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsubsection*{Unemployment and distortions}

We can now return to the issue we raised earlier:  unemployment.
Where is unemployment in the supply-and-demand analysis of the
labor market?  In Figure~\ref{fig:equilibrium}, we might think of
$L^*$ as representing both employment (the number of people hired
by firms, since the point is on their demand curve) and the labor
force (the number of people who want to work at the going wage).
Unemployment is the difference between these two numbers, so
evidently there is none.  There is an almost perfect analogy
between this market and a dealer-type securities market such as
the Nasdaq.  At the Nasdaq, dealers post bid and ask prices and
are committed to executing transactions at those prices. If you
want to sell a given security, you just contact one of them (or
ask your broker to do this for you).  If you'd like to sell at
less than the bid, you have a deal.  There are no ``unemployed''
securities.

%If the labor market worked this way, individuals would post their
%reservation wage.  If it were low enough, some firm would hit
%itThere could not be unemployment, simply because any person
%willing to work would be able to do so, simply by lowering the
%reservation wage enough.

One of the reasons labor markets don't work this way is that
government policies and local institutions {\it distort\/} the way
they function. Examples include minimum wages, restrictions on
wage adjustments, labor unions, limits on hiring and firing, and
so on. We don't argue that these things are bad --- they may very
well have benefits --- but they do have an impact on how the labor
market works.

The minimum wage is the simplest distortion to study.  If we
prohibit purchases of labor services below a given wage, how does
the market operate?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Figure~\ref{fig:minimum} shows how the supply-and-demand analysis
might be applied in this case.  In the figure, the minimum wage
($w_{m}$) is higher than the equilibrium wage ($w^{*}$) in the
absence of distortions.  At the minimum wage, the supply of labor
(the labor force) is $L^{s}(w_{m})$, which is higher than the
demand $L^{d}(w_{m})$.  Minimum wage laws don't force firms to
hire, so employment is given by their demand function:
$L^{d}(w_{m})$.  The difference between supply and demand is
unemployment:  $L^{s}(w_{m})-L^{d}(w_{m})$ people would like to
work at the wage $w_{m}$ but do not.  The unemployment rate is
therefore $ [L^{s}(w_{m})-L^{d}(w_{m})]/L^{s}(w_{m})$.  As a
practical matter, it's an open question whether the impact of the
minimum wage on unemployment is large or small, but few economists
doubt that it's there.


In class we will consider other forms of distortions, including
mandatory severance payments and labor unions, and examine their
impact on labor market outcomes and the output and productivity of
countries.


\subsubsection*{Job and worker flows}

Modern economies create and destroy jobs (positions) at very high
rates.  New positions are created either because existing firms
expand their operations or because new firms hire workers. We
refer to this phenomenon as \textit{job creation}. At the same
time, existing firms sometimes eliminate positions.  We refer to
this process as \textit{job destruction}.  An establishment (a
production unit, like a factory, or a store) is said to create
jobs if it increases the number of positions between one period
and the next.  The economy's overall job creation is the sum of
the increases in positions across all the establishments that
created jobs.  Similarly, an establishment is said to destroy jobs
when it decreases its number of positions from one period to the
next. The economy's overall job destruction is the sum of the
decreases in jobs across all establishments that destroyed jobs.
The sum of job creation and job destruction is referred to as
\textit{job reallocation} or \textit{job turnover}. Job creation,
destruction, and reallocation \textit{rates} are simply ratios of
job creation, destruction, and reallocation, respectively, to the
total number of jobs in the economy. These rates vary greatly
across countries, but their magnitudes are impressive everywhere.
In the US in 1988, the annual job creation rate in manufacturing
was 8.3\%. The job destruction rate was about the same. Therefore
job reallocation amounted to a staggering 16.7\% a year. For the
US economy as a whole, job creation and destruction rates were
13.0\% and 10.4\%, respectively, over the same period.

Another interesting feature of modern economies is that
individuals change jobs or employment status regularly.  An
employed individual can either stay in her job, move to another
job, become unemployed (leave one job but look for another), or
leave the labor force (leave one job without wanting another).
Similarly, an unemployed person can become employed (get a job),
stay unemployed (look for a job without taking one), or leave the
labor force (stop looking for a job).  Someone out of the labor
force can become employed (take a job), become unemployed (look
for a job without taking one), or remain out of the labor force.
We have information from surveys on each of these possible
changes.

Some summary measures will give you a sense of how this looks for
a typical individual.  {\it Accessions\/} occur when individuals
take new jobs, regardless of their current status. {\it
Separations\/} occur when individuals leave jobs, regardless of
reason. The accession and separation {\it rates\/} are ratios of
accessions and separations, respectively, to total jobs.  The sum
of the two rates is referred to as the \textit{worker reallocation
rate}. In the late 1980s, the annual accession rate in the US was
45.2\% and the annual separation rate was 46.0\%.  The worker
reallocation rate was a staggering 91.2\%! These numbers do not
say why workers change jobs, merely that they do. The numbers for
the US are unusually high.  Worker reallocation rates are
generally lower in other countries, including France (59.6\%) and
Italy (68.1\%). Apparently in the US it is more common both to
leave a job and to take a new job.

%Notice that part of worker reallocation is induced by job
%reallocation. That is, when a job is created, there is always an
%accession and when a job is destroyed there is always a
%separation. The opposite, however is not true. Accessions can
%occur without a new job being created and separations can occur
%without a job being destroyed. This happens whenever a company
%substitutes a worker for another one in exactly the same position.
%The excess of worker reallocation over job reallocation is called \textit{excess worker reallocation}.


One of the roles of financial markets is to promote the
reallocation of capital to more productive uses. There's mounting
evidence that countries whose financial markets better accomplish
this task also perform better. Similarly, there is ample data
showing that the ability of an economy to reallocate jobs across
firms, industries, and geographical areas, as well as the ability
to reallocate workers, is critical to its success. Sometimes labor
market institutions are an obstacle to this reallocation process,
and can have unwanted negative effects on macroeconomic
performance.

Consider an example from Europe. In recent years, the European
airline market has gone through a deregulation process that
resembles the one that characterized the US in the 1980s. Before
deregulation, every European country had its own national airline.
The airline was typically a monopolist on internal routes, and a
(collusive) duopolist (with the other country's airline) on
international routes.  Like most monopolists, these airlines
charged high fares and operated inefficiently.  Now any company
can fly any route in the European Union. The entry of new carriers
(in particular the no-frill Southwest imitators) meant big trouble
for many of the incumbents. Sabena and Swissair went bust. Others
(Alitalia?) will probably follow suit. It is clear that at the end
of the reorganization of the industry, fares will be much lower
(they are already, as a matter of fact). As a result, people will
fly more often and there will be more jobs in the industry. Along
the way, job destruction by the incumbents will be accompanied by
(greater) job creation by the new entrants.

Who gains? Consumers and workers in new firms. Who loses?
Incumbent firms' workers and shareholders.  Standard analysis of
the costs of monopoly tell us that the gains are greater than the
losses, but the political process does not necessarily weight them
equally. In the EU, the speed of adjustment, and even the new
structure of the industry, depend in large part on employment
protection laws. These laws impose high severance costs and often
give unions greater influence in such decisions, with the effect
of reducing the speed of both job destruction (out with the old)
and job creation (in with the new).

The bottom line: laws that ``protect'' jobs often have the effect
of making job creation less attractive. Even if they reduce the
rate of job destruction, as intended, they may ultimately reduce
the number of jobs available. Moreover, they inhibit the economy's
ability to reallocate labor to more productive uses. The impact on
aggregate performance can be large.

%What about the role of excess worker reallocation? When a new
%match between a firm and a worker is formed, the former knows
%little about the latter, and vice-versa. In many instances, they
%discover ex-post that they are not the best match for each other.
%Excess worker reallocation is the process by which the resources

\subsubsection*{Executive summary}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Labor market indicators include employment (the number of
people working), unemployment (the number not working who would
like to), the labor force (employment plus unemployment), and the
unemployment rate (the ratio of unemployment to the labor force).

\item ``Distortions'' are a major source of unemployment.

\item Policies to increase in employment in market economies must make it attractive to firms to hire more workers.  As US Senator Joseph Lieberman puts it:  ``You can't be both pro-jobs and anti-business.''

\item Developed economies are characterized by high rates of job
and worker reallocation: people change jobs and firms change
workers --- frequently.

\item The efficiency of work reallocation affects the performance
of the economy as a whole.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item (indicators) You are the mayor of a small village, whose
labor market data are: population (100), employment (55), and
unemployment (5).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a circle on a piece of paper corresponding to the
population of your village. Divide it into sections corresponding
to employment, unemployment, labor force, and not in the labor
force.

\item Compute the participation rate and the unemployment rate.
\end{enumerate}

Answer.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For you to do.

\item The participation rate is 60\% [$= (55+5)/100$] and the
unemployment rate is 8.3\% [$= 5/60$].
\end{enumerate}

\item (supply and demand) Consider an economy with one firm (which
is nevertheless a price taker).  It produces widgets according to
the production function $Y = A K^{1/2}L^{1/2}$ and sells them for
2 dollars each.  For simplicity, assume that $A = K = 1$.  The
supply of labor in this economy is $L^{s}=w^{3/2}$.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item What are the equilibrium values for the labor force, the
wage, and employment? What is the unemployment rate?

\item Suppose the government imposes a minimum wage of \$1.1. What
are the equilibrium values for the labor force, the wage, and
employment? What is the unemployment rate?
\end{enumerate}

Answer.
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item The demand for labor is given by $L^{d}(w) = 1 [ 2 \times
(1/2)]/{w}]^{2} = w^{-2}$.  [This follows from the labor demand
function, equation (\ref{eq:ld})].  Equating demand and supply
yields $L^{*}=w^{*}=1$. The labor force is one and the
unemployment rate is zero.

\item With a minimum wage of \$1.1, the supply of labor (the labor
force) is $1.1^{{3}/{2}} = 1.15$. The demand for labor is
$1.1^{-2}=0.826$. Therefore employment is 0.826 and the
unemployment rate is $(1.15-0.826)/{1.15}= .2817$ or 28.17\%.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
