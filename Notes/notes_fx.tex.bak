Exchange rates (prices of foreign currency)
are a central element of most international transactions.
When Heineken sells beer in the US,
its euro profits depend on its euro costs of production,
its dollar revenues in the US, and the dollar-euro exchange rate.
When a Tokyo resident purchases a dollar-denominated asset,
her return (in yen) depends on the asset's dollar yield
and the change in the dollar-yen exchange rate.
The level and change of exchange rates are therefore
important aspects of international business.

We'll learn two things about exchange rates
in what follows:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item In flexible exchange rate system,
short-term fluctuations are substantial, largely unpredictable,
and close to inexplicable.
That's been horribly disappointing to those of us who would like to
understand them better, but it's a fact of life.
From a business perspective, they're a source of random noise.
Heineken profits, for example, vary with the dollar-euro rate,
even if the underlying business doesn't change.

\item Fixed exchange rates remain fixed only through central bank support.
The central bank must be willing and able to exchange foreign and
domestic currencies at the stated rate or the whole thing collapses.
This is a common trigger in emerging market crises:
when the central bank runs out of foreign currency,
it can no longer maintain the value of domestic currency.
Chaos ensues.
\end{itemize}
%
These issues are the subjects of Parts I and II, respectively.


\subsubsection*{Terminology}

There is an enormous amount of jargon associated with this subject.
You'll run across references to:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Exchange rate regimes.\/}
Governments follow a range of policies toward the prices of their currencies.
One aspect of policy is whether people and businesses can freely
exchange their currency for another:
whether the currency is {\it convertible\/}.
The US dollar, for example, is convertible,
but the renminbi is not:  you need approval from the Chinese central
bank to buy or sell Chinese currency.
Another aspect of policy is whether the price is set by the government,
allowed to float freely, or something in between.
If the government sets the price, we say it has a
fixed exchange rate  regime.
If the price is determined in a free market, we say we have a
{\it flexible\/} or {\it floating\/} exchange rate regime.


\item {\it Exchange rate conventions.\/}
I typically express exchange rates as local currency prices of
one unit of foreign currency.
In the US, we might refer to the dollar price of one euro.
In currency markets, the conventions vary (every currency is different),
but I'll try to stick with this one.
It has the somewhat strange feature that
an increase in the exchange rate is a decline in the relative value of the home currency,
but remember that it's an increase in the value of the foreign currency.
As a rule of thumb, remember that we quote prices in dollars
(or whatever our local currency is).

Changes in exchange rates also have their own names.
For a flexible exchange rate,
we refer to a decrease in the value of a currency as a
{\it depreciation\/} and an increase as an {\it appreciation\/}.
For a fixed exchange rate, where the changes reflect policy,
the analogous terms are {\it devaluation\/} and {\it revaluation\/}.

\item {\it Real exchange rates.\/}
You'll see this term, too, but what does it mean?
(What's an imaginary exchange rate?)
A nominal exchange rate is the price of a currency:
the number of units of currency A needed to buy one unit
of currency B.
The real exchange rate is the relative price of commodity or
basket of goods.
If $P$ is the US CPI in dollars, $P^*$ is the European CPI in euros,
and $e$ is the dollar price of one euro (the {\it nominal} exchange rate), then the (CPI-based) {\it real exchange rate\/} between the US and the Euro Zone is
\[
    \mbox{\it RER\/}  \;=\; e P^* /P ,
\]
the ratio of the price of EU goods to US goods,
with both expressed in the same units (here dollars).
(Note:  asterisks are commonly used to denote foreign values.)

\item {\it Parity relations.\/}
We generally think that trade will tend to reduce differences in prices and returns across countries.
Parity relations are based on the assumption that differences are
eliminated altogether.  It's an extreme assumption, to be sure,
but a useful benchmark.
{\it Purchasing power parity\/} is the theory that prices of baskets of goods are equal across countries:  $P = e P^* $
(or $\mbox{\it RER\/} = 1$).
This works for some specific goods (think of gold),
but anyone who takes a vacation abroad realizes that it is
at best a crude approximation for
broad categories of goods (hotels, restaurant meals, or the CPI).
{\it Interest rate parity\/} is the assumption that returns are equal
for comparable investments in different currencies --- think of US and Japanese treasury bills, or dollar- and yen-denominated eurocurrency deposits at major banks.
Despite the globalization of financial markets,
this doesn't work that well either.  % ?? covered ? uncovered?
%The carry trade is devoted to exploiting differences
%in expected returns across currencies.

\end{itemize}
%
You'll see each of these shortly.

\centerline{\bf Part I:  Predictability of Exchange Rates}

\subsubsection*{Properties of exchange rates}

Flexible exchange rates move around --- a lot.
The standard deviation of annual rates of change of currency prices
is 10-12\% for major currencies, more for emerging markets.
That's less than the standard deviation of equity returns
(the return on the S\&P 500 index has a standard deviation of 16-18\%)
but a significant source of risk.
With a standard deviation of 10\%, and a normal distribution,
there's a 5\% chance of seeing a one-year change greater than 20\%
either up or down.
(That's if we use the normal distribution.
Since currencies have fat tails, it's really a little worse than that.)

%Even worse, these changes are largely unpredictable.

You can get a sense of recent dollar movements from
Figure~\ref{fig:exch_rates},
which plots the price of one dollar expressed in Australian dollars,
British pounds, Canadian dollars, euros, yen, and renminbi, respectively.
(Inverses of dollar exchange rates, in other words.)
They are constructed as indexes, with the January 2001 values
set equal to 100.
You can see that the dollar-euro rate fluctuates quite a bit;
over the last five years, it's ranged from 70 to 110.
This reflects, to a large extent, the approaches taken by
the US and the European central banks:
they let their currencies float freely.
The yen, the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar
are similar.
The renminbi, however, is fixed (or close to it)
by the Chinese central bank at a value of about 8 yuan per dollar.
%Fixed exchange rates are fairly common among developing countries.
More on this later.

\subsubsection*{Purchasing power parity}

So we've seen that exchange rates move around.
But can we say anything about why?
The answer is no,
but here's a theory that is useful in giving us
a benchmark or anchor we can use to decide whether exchange rates
seem sensible.

The idea is to compare prices of goods.
You'd be wrong, but imagine that exchange rates adjust to
equate prices across countries.
The logic is arbitrage:  if a good is cheaper in one
country than another, then people would buy in the cheap country
and sell in the other, taking a profit on the way.
This process will tend to eliminate the difference in prices.

Consider wine.
Suppose a bottle of (some specific) wine costs $p=26$ dollars in New York,
and $p^*=20$ euros in Paris.
Are the prices the same?
If the exchange rate is $e=1.3$ dollars per euro,
then the New York and Paris prices are the same once we express them
in the same units.
More generally, we might say that
\begin{equation}
    p \;=\; e p^* .
\end{equation}
We refer to this relation as the {\it law of one price\/}:
that a product should sell for the same price in two locations.
An even better example might be gold,
which sells for pretty much the same price in
New York, London, and Tokyo.

If the law of one price works for some products,
there are many more for which restrictions on
trade (tariffs or quotas), or transportation costs,
or other ``frictions'' prevent arbitrage.
Agricultural products, for example, are protected in many countries,
leading to substantial differences across countries
in the prices of such basic commodities as rice, wheat, and sugar.
Cement faces substantial shipping costs, even within countries.
Many services (haircuts, dry cleaning, medical and legal services)
are inherently difficult to trade,
and often protected by regulation as well.

{\it The Economist\/}, with its usual flair for combining insight
with entertainment, computes dollar prices of the Big Mac around the
world.
The idea is that it's the same product everywhere, so differences
in prices reflect deviations from the law of one price.
In January 2006, Big Mac prices were \$3.15 in the US,
\$3.55 in the Euro Zone, \$2.19 in Japan, \$1.55 in Argentina,
and \$1.30 in China. The price differences are not only large, they vary
widely over time. In April 2000, the prices were \$2.50 in the US,
\$2.78 in Japan, and \$2.50 in Argentina, implying much higher
relative prices in Japan and Argentina.
Perhaps it's no surprise that the law of one price doesn't hold:
you can imagine the mess involved in trying to arbitrage price
differences.
But it's a good illustration of international price differences
more generally.


Despite such modest encouragement,
the first-cut theory of exchange rates is based on an application of
law-of-one-price logic to broad baskets of goods.
The so-called theory of purchasing power parity (PPP)
is that local and foreign price indexes ($P$ and $P^*$, say)
are linked through the exchange rate:  $ P \approx e P^* $ or
\begin{equation}
    \mbox{\it RER\/} \;=\; eP^* /P \;\approx\; 1.
\end{equation}
The approximation symbol suggests that we don't expect this to be perfect.
In the most common applications, the price indexes are CPIs
(consumer price indexes)
and we refer to the measure of the real exchange rate as CPI-based.
If this doesn't work for specific goods, why might we expect it to hold
for average prices of goods?
One reason is that, for any pair of countries,
we might see as many products that are ``overpriced"
as there are products that are ``underpriced."
When we average, these deviations could offset each other.
In fact, they don't.
If prices of some goods are cheaper abroad, then prices
of other goods tend to be, too.

What limited success we have comes in the long run.
As an empirical matter,
deviations from PPP tend to average out over time.
Sometimes prices are higher in Paris, sometimes higher in New York,
but on average prices are roughly comparable.
Prices are lower, on average, in countries with lower GDP per capita,
% Call this Balassa-Sam ??
but here, too, large fluctuations in the real exchange rate tend to disappear
with time.
How much time do we need for this to work?
At least several years.
If you're thinking of going to Paris this summer,
there's no reason to expect that it will become cheaper
between now and then.


Real exchange rates computed this way are often used to judge whether
a currency's price is reasonable.
If the prices are lower at home than abroad ($\mbox{\it RER\/} > 1$),
we say the (home) currency is {\it undervalued\/},
and if prices are higher at home ($\mbox{\it RER\/} < 1$),
we say the currency is {\it overvalued\/}.
[If this seems mysterious to you, apply it to the problem of taking
a vacation in Paris or Mexico City.]
We can do the same thing with the Big Mac index.
We saw earlier that Big Macs were cheaper in the US than the Euro Zone,
so we might say that the dollar in undervalued relative to the euro.
Big Macs are even cheaper in Japan, so the yen is undervalued relative
to both the dollar and the euro.
Over time, we might expect most of these ``misvaluations'' to decline.
Experience suggests, however, that any such adjustment will take years.
Our best estimates are that half the mispricing will disappear
in 5 years.
We can do the same thing with CPIs, with one difference:
since CPI are indexes, we don't know the absolute prices.
The standard approach is to find the mean value of the real exchange rate
(or its logarithm) and judge under- or overvaluation by comparing the
real exchange rate to its mean, rather than one.


At the risk of trying your patience,
we'll conclude this section by describing PPP in growth rates.
PPP implies that the exchange rate is the ratio of price
indexes:  $ e \approx P/P^*$.
If we take logarithms and first-difference, we have
%
\begin{equation*}
\log(e_{t+1})-\log(e_{t}) \;\approx\;
[\log(P_{t+1})-\log(P_{t})]-[\log(P^{*}_{t+1})-\log(P^{*}_{t})]%
\end{equation*}
%
or
%
\begin{equation*}
    d_{t+1} \;\approx\; \pi_{t+1}-\pi^{*}_{t+1} ,%
\end{equation*}
where $\pi$ and $\pi^*$ are the home and foreign inflation rates
and $ d_{t+1} = \log(e_{t+1})-\log(e_{t}) $
is the rate of depreciation of the home currency.
In words:  PPP implies that rate of change in the exchange rate
should be equal to the difference in inflation rates.


Does this work?  It turns out that the relation
tends to hold in the long-run, but not in the short run, in the
sense that there are plenty of deviations from it. For example, let's
consider the case of the exchange rate between the Venezuelan
Bolivar and the US dollar. Between January 1985 and January 2006,
Venezuela's average annual inflation rate was 30\%, as opposed to
the US's 2.9\%. In the same period, the Bolivar
depreciated at the average yearly rate of 27.9\%, i.e. only .8\%
more than implied by the PPP condition. In the short-run, however,
deviations from PPP are the norm.
Figure~\ref{fig:venezuela} shows that this has definitely been the
case for the Bolivar: there have been plenty of periods in which
exchange rate depreciation did not track closely the inflation
differential with the United States. In some instances, in
particular in the late 80's, the deviations were due to the central
bank's attempt to keep the exchange rate constant.
In other cases (the early 90s for example), the deviations
had probably nothing to do with central bank interventions.
%
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{venezuela.eps}
    \caption{Venezuela: Bolivar's depreciation and inflation differential.}
    \label{fig:venezuela}
\end{figure}
%
In developed countries, it's not unusual to see deviations of
the real exchange rate from one of 30-40\% in either direction.
Figure~\ref{fig:us_euro} shows this for the dollar-euro.
In recent years the US dollar has depreciated against the euro
despite similar inflation rates.
%
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{us_euro.eps}
    \caption{Dollar versus euro and inflation differential.}
    \label{fig:us_euro}
\end{figure}
%
This picture is typical of developed countries:
inflation differentials are relatively small,
so changes in the real and nominal exchange rates are almost equal.
These deviations from PPP tend to disappear with time,
but as we saw earlier, they go away slowly.


\subsubsection*{Interest rate parity (skim only)}

%  ?? change
%  interest diff and uip
%  carry trade and predictions

Exchange rates also play a role in interest rate differences across
countries. In June 2004, for example, 3-month eurodollar deposits
paid interest rates of 1.40\% in US dollars, 4.78\% in British
pounds, 5.48\% in Australian dollars, and 2.12\% in euros. If
international capital markets are so closely connected, why do we see
such differences?  The answer is that these returns are
expressed in different currencies, so they're not directly comparable.


Let's think about how prices of currencies show up in interest rate
differentials. We'll start with a relation called {\em covered
interest parity}, which says that interest rates denominated in
different currencies are the same once you ``cover'' yourself
against possible currency changes.  The argument follows the
standard logic of arbitrage used endlessly in finance.  Let's
compare two equivalent strategies for investing one US dollar for 3
months. The first strategy is to invest one dollar in a 3-month
euro-dollar deposit (with the stress on ``dollar''). After three
months that leaves us with $(1+i/4)$  dollars, where $i$ is the
dollar rate of interest expressed as an annual rate.

What if we invested one dollar in euro-denominated instruments? Here
we need several steps to express the return in dollars and make it
comparable to the first strategy. Step one is to convert the dollar
to euros, leaving us with $1/e$ euros ($e$ is the spot exchange rate
-- the dollar price of one euro). Step two is to invest this money
in a 3-month euro deposit, earning the annualized rate of return
$i^{*}$. That leaves us with $(1+i^{*}/4)/e$ euros after three
months. We could convert it at the spot rate prevailing three months
from now, but that exposes us to the risk that the euro will fall.
An alternative is to sell euros forward at price $f$. In three
months, we will have $(1+i^{*}/4)/e$ euros that we want to convert
back to dollars. With a three-month forward contract, we arrange now
to convert them at the forward rate $f$ expressed, like $e$, as
dollars per euro. This strategy leaves us with $(1+i^{*}/4)f/e$
dollars after three months.

Thus we have two relatively riskless  strategies, one yielding
$(1+i/4)$, the other yielding $(1+i^{*}/4)f/e$. Which is better?
Well, if either strategy had a higher payoff, you could short one
and go long the other, earning extra interest with no risk.
Arbitrage will tend to drive the two together:
\begin{equation}
                            (1+i/4) \;=\; (1+i^{*}/4)f/e.
                            \label{eq:cip}
\end{equation}
We call (\ref{eq:cip}) {\it covered interest parity\/}.
Currency traders assure us that covered interest parity
is an extremely good approximation in the data.
The only difference between the left and right sides is a bid-ask spread,
which averages less than 0.05\% for major currencies.


A related issue is whether international differences
in interest rates reflect differences in expected depreciation rates.
Does the high rate on Aussie dollars (AUD)
reflect the market's assessment that
the AUD will fall in value relative to (say) the euro?
To see how this works, suppose
we converted the proceeds of our foreign investment
back to local currency at the exchange rate prevailing
in 3 months.  Our return would then be
\[
                            (1+i^{*}/4) e_{3}/e ,
\]
where $e_3$ is the spot exchange rate 3 months in the future.
This investment is risky, since we don't know what the
future exchange rate will be, but we might expect
it to have a similar expected return to a local investment.
That is,
\begin{equation}
                            (1+i/4) \;=\; (1+i^{*}/4) E (e_{3})/e ,
                            \label{eq:uip}
\end{equation}
where $E(e_3)$ is our current expectation
of the exchange rate in 3 months.
This relation is an application of the expectations hypothesis to
currency prices (the forward rate equals the expected future spot rate)
that is commonly referred to as {\it uncovered interest parity\/}.


In fact, uncovered interest rate parity doesn't work.
It implies that high interest rate currencies depreciate,
when in fact they appreciate (increase in value),
making them good investments on average.
If $i>i^*$, we invest at home.  If $i<i^*$, we invest abroad,
expecting to pocket not only the higher interest rate but
an appreciation of the currency ($e_3>e$).
Why this investment opportunity persists remains something of a mystery to
academics and investors alike.
Two fine points:  (i)~This feature of the data does not apply to
the currencies of developing countries, where higher interest rates
typically imply future depreciation.
(ii)~Even in developed countries, forecasts of exchange rate changes based on interest differentials have an $R^2$ of about 0.05.
That's still useful for investment purposes,
but leaves most of the variance of exchange rate changes unexplained.


\subsubsection*{Predicting exchange rates}

Let's summarize what we've learned about movements in exchange rates:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item PPP works reasonably well over long periods of time,
but has little empirical content over periods of less than a few years,
and virtually none over periods under a year.

\item Interest rate differentials have some forecasting power,
with high interest rate currency increasing in value on average,
the they leave most of the variance of exchange rate movements
 unexplained.
\end{itemize}
%
Can we do better than this?
A little, but probably no more than that.
It's extremely hard to forecast exchange rates better than
a 50-50 bet on up or down.
Interest differentials do a little better, but only a little.
The $R^2$ are less than 0.05.
We may be able to do better still
using more complex theory or personal judgment about policy,
but years of failure suggest that
it's very hard to beat a random walk consistently.

\centerline{\bf Part II:  Fixed exchange rate regimes}


\subsubsection*{Fixing exchange rates}

The primary difference between currency markets and others
is the direct role of the government,
specifically the central bank.
China, for example, has adopted a ``fixed'' or ``pegged'' exchange rate,
which means it follows policies that maintain a given official value
for exchange rate with minimal day-to-day movement around that value.
The US, on the other hand, has a ``flexible'' or ``floating'' exchange rate,
in which the dollar fluctuates in value
against other currencies with little
direct intervention in currency markets.
We say that China and the US have adopted different exchange rate ``regimes.''

How does a fixed exchange rate system work?
Can a central bank simply announce a rate?
Probably not.
I can't make people trade at the stated price
I could claim, for example, that my apartment was worth
\$10m, but if no one is willing to buy it for that price
the statement is meaningless.
For the same reason, a central bank must back up its
claim to fix the exchange rate by buying and selling as much foreign currency as people want at the stated price.


Let's think through how this might work.
Suppose the New York City government decided to fix the price of beer at \$2 a 6-pack (cheap even if you live outside NYC).
It supports this price by buying or selling
any amount at the quoted price.  Can they keep the price this low?
Our guess is that at this price,
beermakers would not find it profitable to make any
(at least not any that we'd be willing to call beer).  People would then flood the government with requests for beer, which the government would
not be able to meet.  When the government reneged on its promise to buy or sell at \$2, the price
would rise above \$2 to its market level, either officially or on the black market.
In short, unless the government has enough beer to back up the price,
the system will collapse.
Alternatively, suppose the government set the price at \$20.
Beermakers would flood the government with beer at this price, leaving the
government with a huge surplus.  This is roughly what Europeans do with agriculture, where artificially high prices have left the EU with
``mountains of butter," ``lakes of wine," and so on.
The point is that the government can only fix a price
if it is willing and able to buy and sell at that price.

     The same logic applies to currencies.
If the People's Bank of China were to support an excessively high price for
the renminbi, then they would be flooded with offers from traders
selling renminbi for (say) dollars.
Its balance sheet would look something like this:
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrclr}
               Assets  &     &&     Liabilities                     \\
               \hline
               FX Reserves &  20 &&     Money &  200   \\
               Bonds   & 180 && \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
We made these numbers up, but they give us the right idea:
the central bank has the usual liabilities,
``money" and government bonds,
and also holds some foreign currency reserves,
which you might think of (for this example) as dollars.
The PBC intervenes in the currency market by trading renminbi for dollars,
and vice versa, depending on market conditions.
Suppose, for example, that Nike wanted to convert
\$2m to renminbi for the purpose of building a new plant.
It would do this through a Chinese bank.
If the bank had no countervailing trades, it would
go to the PBC and exchange the \$2m for renminbi at the going rate
--- say 10 yuan per dollar, to make the arithmetic simple.
The PBC's balance sheet would then show an increase of
20m yuan worth of foreign currency
and a comparable increase in its monetary base:
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrclr}
               Assets  &     &&     Liabilities                     \\
               \hline
               FX Reserves &  40 &&     Money &  220   \\
               Bonds  & 180 &&
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
The PBC's net worth is unchanged,
since it has exchanged assets with equal value.


[Update:  The PBC's fixed exchange rate was revalued
(increased in value) in July 2005.
Since then, the PBC has allowed modest changes in value,
with the net result that it has appreciated
somewhat against the dollar.]


The difference, then, between fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes
is that the former obligates the central bank to buy and sell
currencies at the stated price.
As a matter of experience, fixed exchange rate systems often collapse ---
sometimes spectacularly --- when the central bank runs out of reserves.
The issue:  if people would prefer to buy foreign currency at the official
exchange rate, the central bank may find that its supply of reserves is not
enough to meet the market demand.
(The market for currencies is enormous, so you need a lot of reserves.)
For that reason, currency traders often look closely at central bank's
foreign currency reserves to measure their ability to maintain the rate.


In China and many other developing countries,
there are often further restrictions on the ability of private agents to buy and sell currency (``convertibility'').
Citizens are sometimes prohibited from using foreign currency for
domestic transactions.
They may also face limits on their ability to buy foreign currency
to buy foreign goods or assets.
In China, for example, purchases of foreign currency are generally allowed
to buy foreign goods, but not to buy foreign assets.
This, of course, has an impact on the market value of the currency,
making it more difficult for investors to bet for or against a change
in the value of the renminbi.


\subsubsection*{Exchange rate crises}

We've seen how fixed exchange rates work:  the central bank
agrees to buy or sell as much foreign currency as it takes
to fix the rate.
But what happens if people want to exchange your currency for foreign
currency, as happened in Mexico in December 1994?
If the central bank runs out of foreign currency (dollars, in this case),
then it has no way to enforce the official rate.

Suppose the central bank's balance sheet looks like the one above,
with ``fx reserves'' of 40.  And suppose, further, that investors
would like to exchange 50 worth of pesos for the same value in dollars.
Once the central bank runs out of dollars, it can no longer support
the exchange rate, which becomes (more or less automatically) floating.

That's a standard part of how fixed exchange rate systems blow up:
the promise to fix the rate is only as good as the central bank's
ability to trade at that price.
If it runs out of reserves, the promise is seen to be empty.
That raises an interesting question about whether exchange rates
are more or less volatile in a flexible exchange rate regime.
With flexible rates, we tend to see a lot of short-run volatility ---
Figure  \ref{fig:exch_rates}, for example.
With fixed exchange rates, short-run volatility is low,
but we occasionally have very large changes if the system collapses.
%And if you're trying to assess hood of a crisis,
%one of the things you'd look at is the quantity of reserves.


\subsubsection*{Executive summary}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In the long run, exchange rates tend to
equalize prices of products across countries (PPP).

\item In the short run, exchange rate movements are large
and unpredictable.

\item Foreign currency reserves are an indicator of the
government's ability to maintain a fixed exchange rate.

\subsubsection*{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Forecasting the euro.
Right now, the euro is ``overvalued'' in PPP terms relative to the
dollar (goods are more expensive in Europe) and Euro Zone short-term interest rates remain 2-3\% above US interest rates.
Given these facts, how would you expect the euro/dollar exchange rate to change over the next 6 months?  6 years?
How good is each of these informed guesses?

Answer.  Purchasing power parity is a long-run ``anchor'' for the
exchange rate:  if prices of goods and services in the Euro Zone
are higher than those in the US, when expressed in a common currency,
we'd expect the euro to fall in value relative to the dollar
--- eventually.
This is pretty much useless over a period as short as 6 months,
but has some content over 6 years.
More useful in the short-run is the interest differential.
Since the Euro interest rate is higher, we'd expect the euro to increase in value.
Neither works all that well:  an $R^2$ of 0.05 would be good over
periods of a few months.


\item Foreign exchange market intervention.
Use a hypothetical central bank balance sheet to show how
purchases of foreign currency affect the bank's assets and liabilities. What does this purchase do to the supply of money (currency)?

Answer.  When a central bank buys foreign currency,
it receives it from private owners and gives them
    domestic currency in return.
    The latter is an increase in the domestic money supply.
    Suppose, for example, the central bank
    starts with the balance sheet
    %
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrclr}
               Assets  &     &&     Liabilities                     \\
               \hline
               FX Reserves &  100 &&     Money  &  200   \\
               Bonds   & 100 && \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
The purchase of 25 worth of foreign currency
changes the balance sheet to
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrclr}
               Assets  &     &&     Liabilities                     \\
               \hline
               FX Reserves &  125 &&     Money  &  225   \\
               Bonds   & 100 && \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%

\item Sterilization.  Suppose the central bank has increased the money supply by purchasing foreign currency, as described above.
    How might it offset this impact on the money supply (sterilize it, so to speak)?

Answer.  It does an equal sale of bonds, accepting money in return.
If it sells 25 worth of bonds, the balance sheet changes to
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrclr}
               Assets  &     &&     Liabilities                     \\
               \hline
               FX Reserves &  125 &&     Money  &  200   \\
               Bonds   & 75 && \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
The net result of the two trades is that it's liabilities are now more heavily weighted in foreign currency.
If the foreign currency rises, it makes money; if it falls, it loses money.
This posture is designed as protection against a sharp fall in local currency (or rise in foreign currency), and it does that.
