\bigskip
Milton Friedman, winner of the 1976 Nobel Prize in economics, once
said: ``Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.
To control inflation, you need to control the money supply.''
Friedman believed what he said, but he also enjoyed
thumbing his nose at the popular Keynesian theory of the 1960s,
in which inflation was the result of excess demand for goods.

Was Friedman right?
We consider his claim in the context of hyperinflations:
episodes of very high inflation, 100\% per year or more.
Although extreme, hypinflations are a recurring phenomenon
and a wonderful laboratory for
studying inflation more generally.
In these situations (but not necessarily in others), 
money growth is present, 
but it's invariably connected to government deficits.  
The key to stopping inflation, then, is to 
balance the government's budget.  


\subsubsection*{The quantity theory}

Friedman's claim about inflation is based on a theory that is
several centuries old: the {\it quantity theory of
money\/}. Like a lot of good theory, it's based on an analogy. Think
for a moment about the effect of a two-for-one stock split on the
price of a stock. If it's now selling for 100, then you'd probably
expect it to sell for 50 after the split. (This wouldn't be true if
the split were a signal of some new information about the firm,
but let's assume it's not.) The point is that the value of a firm's
total stock of equity shouldn't depend on anything as arbitrary as
the number of shares.

Now suppose we do the same thing with money.  This is
unrealistically simple, but makes the point effectively. Suppose the
government replaced every dollar with two ``new dollars,''
marked so we can tell the difference between old and new notes. Then
you'd expect, I think, that new dollars would be worth half as much
as old dollars. That is, you'd expect prices of goods and services
quoted in new dollars to be twice as high as prices quoted in old
dollars. In short, changes in the quantity of money in circulation
(the ``money supply'') executed in this way will be associated with
proportionate changes in prices, with no effect on output.  Why the
latter? Because output is determined by productivity and inputs, and
we wouldn't expect either one to be influenced by the number of
pieces of paper used to make transactions.

Of course the world is more complicated than this, and monetary
policy consists of more than just currency exchanges, but some of
the same reasoning applies more generally (we'll look at some data
shortly). The quantity theory is the result of two ideas:  that
money is not fundamental (pieces of paper don't change the
productivity of the US or Chinese economies), and that its
usefulness is in executing transactions.  Let's start with the
latter. In all developed economies, transactions consists of
exchanges of goods and services for money. This means that, by
definition, the amount of money $M$ in circulation must equal the
dollar volume of transactions. If we approximate the volume of
transactions in an economy by nominal GDP, then we have
$M=PY$, where $Y$ is real GDP and $P$ is a measure of the
price level such as the GDP deflator. This isn't quite right yet. A
dollar can be used to execute several different transactions in a
given year.
To take this into account, we use
%
\begin{equation}
    M V  \;\equiv\;  P Y,
    \label{eq:quantity_theory}
\end{equation}
%
where $V$ is the \textit{velocity} of money: the number of times a
dollar is used to execute transactions in a given year.

At this level of generality,
equation (\ref{eq:quantity_theory}) is a tautology:
for any data we collect on $M$, $P$, and $Y$,
we simply choose $V$ to make the equation hold.
What gives the equation content is the
assumption that velocity $V$ is (at least approximately)
constant.  This implies that increases in $M$ are associated with
proportionate increases in $PY$.
We add one further assumption to get Friedman's connection between
money and prices:
that real GDP is determined by the productivity and inputs of the economy,
and is not affected by the amount of money in circulation.
We can change that later, but it seems like a good place to start.


The same theory explains inflation if we express it in growth rates.
As with growth accounting, we define growth rates as differences
in (natural) logs.
Thus the growth rate of a variable $X$ is
$ \gamma_X = \log X_t - \log X_{t-1}$.
In logs, equation (\ref{eq:quantity_theory}) and its first difference are
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \log M_t + \log V_t &=& \log P_t + \log Y_t \\
    (\log M_t - \log M_{t-1})  + (\log V_t - \log V_{t-1})
                 &=& (\log P_t - \log P_{t-1}) + (\log Y_t - \log Y_{t-1})\\
    \gamma_M  + \gamma_V &=&  \pi + \gamma_Y ,
\end{eqnarray*}
%
where $\pi = \gamma_P $ is the inflation rate
(rate of growth of the price level).
If velocity is constant,
\begin{eqnarray}
    \gamma_M   &=&  \pi + \gamma_Y ,
    \label{eq:quantity_theory-growth}
\end{eqnarray}
and changes in the growth rate of money are associated
with changes in the growth rate of inflation and output.
The second assumption is that the growth rate of money does not influence
output, so changes in money growth translate one-for-one
into changes in inflation.
That's Friedman's argument.


\subsubsection*{Evidence}

It's not that easy to check the second assumption, but we can
check the first (constant velocity) by looking at the components of
equation (\ref{eq:quantity_theory}).
They imply that velocity is constant and that movements in the price
level $P$ mirror those in $M/Y$.
You can see both in Figure~\ref{fig:quantity_long} for the US.
(Money here is M2, a detail we recommend you ignore --- forever.)
The figure suggests that the theory is a reasonable approximation of the data, at least
over the last fifty years or so. 
The two increasing lines ($P$ and
$M/Y$) show some short-run differences, but their movements are similar.
Velocity itself wiggles around a little, but is not
much different now than it was in 1960.

    \caption{The quantity theory in the long run.}
    \label{fig:quantity_long}
\end{figure}
%

The evidence for short-run changes is much different.
When we look at deviations from trend (Figure~\ref{fig:quantity_short}), movements in prices are only loosely related to movements in money, and
velocity has as much short-run volatility as the stock of money.
%We'll discuss the short run later in the course, where we try to
%figure out the impact of monetary policy on real output,
%inflation, and interest rates.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection*{Changing the money supply}

Currency is a liability of the government,
which can (and does) change the quantity in circulation.
To see how this works, it's helpful to take a
step back and consider the broader issue of government debt.
We can divide the government's debt management into two
related pieces.
The first piece is the size of the debt.
Measured in units of currency (dollars, say, or pesos),
the debt changes over time as the government runs surpluses
or deficits.
Mathematically, we might write:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \mbox{Debt}_{t} &=& \mbox{Debt}_{t-1} + \mbox{Deficit}_t .
\end{eqnarray*}
This is an example of a government budget constraint, something
we'll see more of later on.
The second piece is the composition of the debt.
In practice, governments have lots of different liabilities,
but for the purposes of this discussion let us say it has two:
government bonds and money (currency).
In both theory and practice,
these two pieces are typically separate,
with the treasury issuing bonds to cover the entire debt
and the monetary authority (central bank) buying back
some of these bonds and issuing money in return.

Day-to-day monetary policy is most countries consists of what we term
{\it open market purchases\/} or {\it sales\/} of government debt (bonds).
At any point in time, the treasury's balance sheet looks
something like
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lr|lr}
%\multicolumn{4}{l}{Treasury} \\
Assets  &&  Liabilities \\
\hline
& & Bonds & 200
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
and the central bank's looks like
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lr|lr}
Assets  &&  Liabilities \\
\hline
Bonds &  100 & Money & 100
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
If it seems strange to treat money as a liability of the
central bank (isn't money an asset?),
think of it as a bond with the unusual
feature that its nominal interest rate is zero.
That's what it is, which makes it a good deal for the borrower.


An open market purchase of bonds results in an increase
in bonds held by the central bank and an equal increase in its
monetary liability.
For example, a purchase of 20 worth of bonds would change its
balance sheet to
%
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lr|lr}
Assets  &&  Liabilities \\
\hline
Bonds &  120 & Money & 120
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
The result is an increase in the amount of money in private hands,
since the private sector (the other side of this transaction)
has reduced its holdings of government bonds
and increased its holdings of money.
Similarly, an open market sale of bonds would reduce the amount of money in
private hands.

The question we're leading up to is why money growth is so high
in countries with hyperinflations.
Why does the central bank keep issuing money?


\subsubsection*{Hyperinflations}

%Inflation is now low in most developed countries, but there are
%periodic outbursts of high inflation around the world.  The term
%{\it hyperinflation\/} is generally used to mean inflation rates
%above 100\% a year, but in some cases annual inflation rates
%exceeded 1,000\%! Chances are we'll see one again --- soon.

If inflation is as easily cured as Friedman suggests
(``control the money supply''),
why do big inflations happen?
People who live through such
episodes describe them as traumatic; they spend an hour or more
every day converting cash into anything with stable value:  real estate,
cars, foreign assets.
The economy is usually a mess, but whether's that cause or effect is
hard to say.
But if hyperinflations are so painful, why do governments let them happen?
The problem, typically, starts with a government deficit.
A political impasse makes it nearly impossible to reduce the deficit.
Given the government's budget constraint, it must then issue debt.
There is apparently no shortage of ready buyers of US debt
(ditto other developed countries),
but the same can't be said for every country.
If no one will buy its debt,
the remaining option is to finance the deficit with money
(read: oblige the central bank to purchase bonds
from the treasury).
In short, when the government can't
pay its bills in any other way, it pays them with money, which is
easy enough to print.
The effect of this, of course, is inflation.


The conventional solution to hyperinflation has two parts.  The
first is fiscal discipline: balance the government budget.  The
second is monetary discipline: separate the central bank
from the treasury and tell the bank that its job is to maintain
price stability. There are lots of fine points --- how quickly must
the deficit be eliminated?  should the IMF supply short-term
financing?  --- but the outlines of the problem and its solution
are clear.
%Brazil managed to bring inflation under control by tightening its budget.
Going back to Friedman's quote: inflation may be a monetary phenomenon,
but the trouble often starts with fiscal policy ---
and the political situation that led to it.

For someone operating an international business,
the thing to remember is that ``big inflations''
are relatively common.
What do you do if you're hit with one?
You'll probably find that the
most important thing you can do is streamline your cash management.
If you can reduce the payment
terms from (say) 60 days to 30 days, you increase your ``real'' revenue substantially.
You may also find that big inflations lead to policies,
like price controls and capital controls,
that make life more complicated.
Finally, you may find that your financial statements
are highly misleading, since they measure performance in terms of the local
currency, whose value is changing rapidly.
For a US subsidiary, high inflation triggers a change
in the rules for translating financial entries into dollars for tax and reporting purposes.

\subsubsection*{Inflation and interest rates}

The interest rates we typically use are nominal:
they tell us how much money we get in the future
for a given investment of money today.  
Since inflation measures the change in the value
of money, it shows up in interest rates.
More concretely, we would say that the nominal interest 
rate equals the real interest rate (the interest rate
adjusted for inflation) and inflation:  
\begin{eqnarray}
    i &=& r + \pi . 
    \label{eq:fisher} 
\end{eqnarray}
For a given real interest rate $r$, 
an increase in inflation raises the nominal interest rate
one for one.  

If you buy that, you can stop there.
If you want a deeper explanation,  here's how it works.  
Consider a one-year interest rate on a Treasury bill. 
The rate tells us how many dollars (say) 
we get in one year for a given payment of dollars today.  
For example, if a 12-month treasury bill has a price
of \$96.15, its annualized yield is the value of $i$ that solves
%
\begin{eqnarray}
    96.15 &=& \frac{100}{1+i}.
    \label{eq:nominal_yield}
\end{eqnarray}
%
In this case, $i = 4\%$.  Thus each dollar invested today gives us
1.04 dollars in 12 months. 
We refer to $i$ as the  {\it nominal rate of interest\/} ---
nominal because its refers to payments of currency.

For many purposes, we'd like to know not only the dollar yield, but
also how much 1.04 dollars will buy when we get it.  If we expect
the inflation rate to be 3\% a year, then we'd guess that 3/4 of the
interest will be eaten up by inflation.  The investment only gains
us about 1\% in terms of purchasing power. 
We refer to the increase in purchasing power as the 
{\it real rate of interest\/} --- real because it refers to the 
quantity of real consumption it finances.  
That gives us equation (\ref{eq:fisher}).  


We can show this more formally
by translating the words into equations more carefully.  
We have just argued that investors are interested not in the money the
bond is a claim to but in what that money will buy. If by ``what
that money will buy'' we mean the basket of goods used to construct
the CPI, we can define the real interest rate $r$ by
%
\[
    (96.15/P_t) \;=\; \frac{100/ P_{t+1}}{1+r_t},
\]
%
where $P_{t}$ is the CPI index in year $t$ and $P_{t+1}$ is the
expected value of the same index in year $t+1$. What we are doing
here is expressing the current bond price, measured in terms of what
it will buy, as the discounted value of the principal, also measured
in terms of what it will buy. Doing a little algebra, we find
%
\begin{equation*}
    (1+r)(P_{t+1}/P_{t})=100/96.15
\end{equation*}
%
Then equation (\ref{eq:nominal_yield}) tells us that the real and
nominal interest rates are related by
\[
    1 + i_t \;=\; (1+r_t)(1+\pi_{t}),
\]
where $(P_{t+1}-P_t)/P_t $ is the expected inflation rate between
$t$ (now) and $t+1$ (a year from now). Since the product
$r_{t}\pi_{t}$ is a small number, it follows that
\begin{eqnarray*}
    i_t  &\approx&  r_t + \pi_{t+1} ,
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\approx$ means ``equals approximately.''
Since the relevant inflation rate is that between now and a year from now, 
we usually replace it with the current expectation.
That is:  it's expected inflation that affects the current interest rate.  

Now that we're done with definitions, we can ask how inflation
affects nominal interest rates.
In principle, either component (the real rate or expected inflation)
can change the nominal interest rate.
In practice, we typically find that in periods of
high and variable inflation,
the inflation component dominates.
This is approximately true of the US, where high-inflation periods
(the 1970s and early 1980s)
are high-interest rate periods, too.
It's even more evident in countries with very high inflation rates.


\subsubsection*{Velocity reconsidered (optional)}

In very high inflation environments,
people often find that that the inflation rate accelerates
quickly, often far exceeding the rate of money growth.
One factor here is velocity, which typically
rises sharply with inflation.
Why?
Because inflation (and nominal interest) is effectively a tax on holding money:
the higher the tax, the less money you hold.
During hyperinflations,
people spend money as soon as they get it, because its
value falls by the minute.
It's common, for example, for people to buy groceries
and gasoline as soon as they get their paychecks;
if they wait even a day or two, their purchasing power falls.

If velocity $V$ rises with inflation, then we can reconsider
\begin{eqnarray}
    \gamma_M + \gamma_V  &=&  \pi + \gamma_Y .
\end{eqnarray}
If $\gamma_Y$ is approximately constant,
then an increase in money growth not only
produces inflation directly,
its impact is magnified by the increase in the
interest rate, which increases velocity ($\gamma_V > 0$).
Similarly, when hyperinflations are reversed,
we often see a larger drop in inflation
than in money growth, as velocity falls.


\subsubsection*{Executive summary}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Over long periods of time, inflation is closely related to money growth.

%\item High inflation is usually associated with
%high (nominal) interest rates.

\item Extremely high rates of inflation are invariably associated with high rates of money growth.

\item High money growth is often the result of financing large fiscal deficits with money.
    The deficits, in turn, often reflect some kind of political gridlock.
    
\item High inflation is typically associated with high interest rates, 
since investors demand higher yields to compensate for the loss of purchasing
power of the currency.    

\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection*{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Friedman suggested that the Fed might do better to adopt
a rule in which it kept the growth rate of the money supply constant.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the growth rate of real GDP is 3\%, on average,
what growth rate of the money supply would deliver
average inflation of 2\%?
\item What are the strengths and weaknesses of such a policy rule?
\end{enumerate}

Answer.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If velocity is constant, then
equation (\ref{eq:quantity_theory-growth}) gives us
a money growth rate of
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \gamma_M &=& \gamma_P + \gamma_Y
            \;\;=\;\;  2 + 3 \;\;=\;\; 5.
\end{eqnarray*}
In words: money growth accommodates inflation and economic growth.
\item Strengths: predictable, good average inflation performance,
avoid major policy mistakes.
Weakness: no room for policy to respond to current conditions.
Compare, for example, policy in the aggregate supply and demand model.
\end{enumerate}

%\end{enumerate}

\item Why do many countries make central banks independent of the
treasury?

Answer.  The idea is that monetary policy should focus on good long-term
performance, and to accomplish this should be immune to
short-term political pressure.
With respect to hyperinflations,
you might argue that if the government does not have access to money finance,
it will be forced to confront its deficit issues earlier,
which is a good thing.

\item If we evolve toward an economy in which transactions are made without
money, what role will the central bank play?

Answer.  Good question, someone should start thinking about that!

\item Zimbabwe ended its hyperinflation by abandoning its currency.  Even official transactions were switched to either US dollars or
    South African rand.
    Does this seem like a good solution?
    Does it make sense for a country to abandon its currency?

Answer.  There's a long tradition of each country having its own currency,
but there's good reason to think at least some countries would be better
off using someone else's.
Zimbabwe has shown no ability to manage its own currency effectively,
so using another sounds like a great idea.
There are other examples --- Panama uses the US dollar ---
and perhaps there should be more.
%The downside is that you lose a degree of freedom in policy.

\item Describe the short- and long-run impact of increasing
the money supply on inflation and output in the aggregate supply
and demand model.
How do your answers compare to the quantity theory:
more money leads to higher prices, period.

Answer.
In the short run, an increase in the money supply increases
both output and the price level.
In the long run, only the price level increases.
The latter is the quantity theory.

\item Go to 
\href{http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/}{FRED} and find 
the 3-month treasury bill rate (TB3MS)
and the consumer price index (CPIAUCSL).  
Manipulate them as needed and graph
the nominal interest rate and inflation rate together.
What do you see?  

Answer.  Do it and see!  

\end{enumerate}
