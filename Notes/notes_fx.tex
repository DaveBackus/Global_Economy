Exchange rates (prices of foreign currency)
are a central element of most international transactions.
When Heineken sells beer in the US,
its euro profits depend on its euro costs of production,
its dollar revenues in the US, and the dollar-euro exchange rate.
When a Tokyo resident purchases a dollar-denominated asset,
her return (in yen) depends on the asset's dollar yield
and the change in the dollar-yen exchange rate.
The level and change of exchange rates are therefore
important aspects of international business.

Nevertheless, countries in which exchange rates are determined 
in open markets find that 
short-term fluctuations are substantial, largely unpredictable,
and hard to explain after the fact.  
That's been horribly disappointing to those of us who would like to
understand them better, but it's a fact of life.
From a business perspective, they're a source of random noise.
Heineken profits, for example, vary with the dollar-euro rate,
even if the underlying business doesn't change.  

What follows is a summary of what we know about exchange rates.  


\subsubsection*{Terminology}

There is an enormous amount of jargon associated with this subject.
You'll run across references to:
%
\begin{itemize}

\item Exchange rate conventions.
We typically express exchange rates as local currency prices of
one unit of foreign currency.
In the US, we might refer to the dollar price of one euro.
In currency markets, the conventions vary 
(every currency pair has its own),
but we'll try to stick with this one.
It has the somewhat strange feature that
an increase in the exchange rate is a decline in the relative value of the home currency.  
Of course, it's also an increase in the value of the foreign currency.
As a rule of thumb, remember that we quote prices in dollars
(or whatever our local currency is).

\item Exchange rate changes. 
Changes in exchange rates also have their own names.
For a flexible exchange rate,
we refer to a decrease in the value of a currency as a
{\it depreciation\/} and an increase as an {\it appreciation\/}.
For a fixed exchange rate, where the changes reflect policy,
the analogous terms are {\it devaluation\/} and {\it revaluation\/}.

\item Real exchange rates.
You'll see this term, too, but what does it mean?
(What's an imaginary exchange rate?)
A nominal exchange rate is the relative price of two currencies:
the number of units of currency A needed to buy one unit
of currency B.
The real exchange rate is the relative price of commodity or
basket of goods.
If $P$ is the US CPI in dollars, $P^*$ is the European CPI in euros,
and $e$ is the dollar price of one euro (the {\it nominal} exchange rate), then the (CPI-based) {\it real exchange rate\/} between the US and the Euro Zone is
\[
    \mbox{\it RER\/}  \;=\; e P^* /P ,
\]
the ratio of the price of EU goods to US goods,
with both expressed in the same units (here dollars).
(Note:  asterisks are commonly used to denote foreign values.)

\item Parity relations.
We generally think that trade (``arbitrage'') 
will tend to reduce differences in prices and returns across countries.
Parity relations are based on the assumption that differences are
eliminated altogether.  It's an extreme assumption, to be sure,
but a useful benchmark.
{\it Purchasing power parity\/} is the theory that prices of baskets of goods are equal across countries:  $P = e P^* $
(or $\mbox{\it RER\/} = 1$).
This works for some specific goods (think of gold),
but anyone who takes a vacation abroad realizes that it is
at best a crude approximation for
broad categories of goods (hotels, restaurant meals, or the CPI).
{\it Interest rate parity\/} is the assumption that returns are equal
for comparable investments in different currencies --- think of US and Japanese treasury bills, or dollar- and yen-denominated eurocurrency deposits at major banks.
Despite the globalization of financial markets,
this doesn't work that well either.  
% ?? covered ? uncovered?
%The carry trade is devoted to exploiting differences
%in expected returns across currencies.

\end{itemize}
%
We'll see each of these in action shortly.


\subsubsection*{Properties of exchange rates}

Flexible exchange rates move around --- a lot.
The standard deviation of annual rates of change of currency prices
is 10-12\% for major currencies, more for emerging markets.
That's less than the standard deviation of equity returns
(the return on the S\&P 500 index has a standard deviation of 16-18\%)
but a significant source of risk.
With a standard deviation of 10\%, and a normal distribution,
there's a 5\% chance of seeing a one-year change greater than 20\%
either up or down.
(That's if we use the normal distribution.
Since currencies have fat tails, it's really a little worse than that.)

%Even worse, these changes are largely unpredictable.

You can get a sense of recent dollar movements from
Figure~\ref{fig:exch_rates},
which plots the price of one dollar expressed in Australian dollars,
British pounds, Canadian dollars, euros, yen, and renminbi, respectively.
(Inverses of dollar exchange rates, in other words.)
They are constructed as indexes, with the January 2001 values
set equal to 100.
You can see that the dollar-euro rate fluctuates quite a bit;
over the last five years, it's ranged from 70 to 110.
This reflects, to a large extent, the approaches taken by
the US and the European central banks:
they let their currencies float freely.
The yen, the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar
are similar.
The renminbi, however, is fixed (or close to it)
by the Chinese central bank at a value of about 8 yuan per dollar.
%Fixed exchange rates are fairly common among developing countries.
More on this later.

\subsubsection*{Purchasing power parity}

So we've seen that exchange rates move around.
But can we say anything about why?
We can't say much about short-term movements, 
but here's a theory that gives us a long-term anchor
for the real exchange rate.  
It's a helpful benchmark.  

The idea is to compare prices of goods.
Suppose exchange rates adjusted to equate prices across countries.
The logic is arbitrage:  if a good is cheaper in one
country than another, then people would buy in the cheap country
and sell in the other, taking a profit on the way.
This process will tend to eliminate the difference in prices, 
either through changes in the exchange rate or the prices themselves.  

Consider wine.
Suppose a bottle of (some specific) wine costs $p=26$ dollars in New York,
and $p^*=20$ euros in Paris.
Are the prices the same?
If the exchange rate is $e=1.3$ dollars per euro,
then the New York and Paris prices are the same once we express them
in the same units.
More generally, we might say that
\begin{equation}
    p \;=\; e p^* .
\end{equation}
We refer to this relation as the {\it law of one price\/}:
that a product should sell for the same price in two locations.
An even better example might be gold,
which sells for pretty much the same price in
New York, London, and Tokyo.

If the law of one price works for some products,
there are many more for which restrictions on
trade (tariffs or quotas), transportation costs,
or other ``frictions'' prevent arbitrage.
Agricultural products, for example, are protected in many countries,
leading to substantial differences across countries
in the prices of such basic commodities as rice, wheat, and sugar.
Cement faces substantial shipping costs, even within countries.
Many services (haircuts, dry cleaning, medical and legal services)
are inherently difficult to trade,
and often protected by regulation as well.

{\it The Economist\/}, with its usual flair for combining insight
with entertainment, computes dollar prices of the Big Mac around the
world.
The idea is that it's the same product everywhere, so differences
in prices reflect deviations from the law of one price.
In January 2006, Big Mac prices were \$3.15 in the US,
\$3.55 in the Euro Zone, \$2.19 in Japan, \$1.55 in Argentina,
and \$1.30 in China. The price differences are not only large, they vary
widely over time. In April 2000, the prices were \$2.50 in the US,
\$2.78 in Japan, and \$2.50 in Argentina, implying much higher
relative prices in Japan and Argentina.
Perhaps it's no surprise that the law of one price doesn't hold:
you can imagine the mess involved in trying to arbitrage price
differences.
But it's a good illustration of international price differences
more generally.


Despite such modest encouragement,
the first-cut theory of exchange rates is based on an application of
law-of-one-price logic to broad baskets of goods.
The so-called theory of purchasing power parity (PPP)
is that local and foreign price indexes ($P$ and $P^*$, say)
are linked through the exchange rate:  $ P \approx e P^* $ or
\begin{eqnarray}
    \mbox{\it RER\/} &=& eP^* /P \;\;\approx\;\; 1.
    \label{eq:ppp} 
\end{eqnarray}
The approximation symbol suggests that we don't expect this to be perfect.
In the most common applications, the price indexes are CPIs
(consumer price indexes)
and we refer to the measure of the real exchange rate as CPI-based.
If this doesn't work for specific goods, why might we expect it to hold
for average prices of goods?
One reason is that, for any pair of countries,
we might see as many products that are ``overpriced"
as there are products that are ``underpriced."
When we average, these deviations could offset each other.
In fact, they don't.
If prices of some goods are cheaper abroad, then prices
of other goods tend to be, too.

What limited success we have comes in the long run.
As an empirical matter,
deviations from PPP tend to average out over time.
Sometimes prices are higher in Paris, sometimes higher in New York,
but on average prices are roughly comparable.
Prices are lower, on average, in countries with lower GDP per capita,
% Call this Balassa-Sam ??
but here, too, large fluctuations in the real exchange rate tend to disappear
with time.
How much time do we need for this to work?
At least several years.
If you're thinking of going to Paris next month, 
there's little reason to expect that we'll be closer to PPP by then.  
Maybe we will, maybe we won't, it's a tossup.  


Real exchange rates computed this way are often used to judge whether
a currency's price is reasonable.
If the prices are lower at home than abroad ($\mbox{\it RER\/} > 1$),
we say the (home) currency is {\it undervalued\/},
and if prices are higher at home ($\mbox{\it RER\/} < 1$),
we say the currency is {\it overvalued\/}.
Over- and under-valued here means relative to our theory of PPP.  
We can do the same thing with the Big Mac index.
We saw earlier that Big Macs were cheaper in the US than the Euro Zone,
so we might say that the dollar is undervalued relative to the euro.
Big Macs are even cheaper in Japan, so the yen is undervalued relative
to both the dollar and the euro.
Over time, we might expect most of these ``misvaluations'' to decline.
Experience suggests, however, that any such adjustment will take years.
Our best estimates are that about half the mispricing will disappear
in 5 years.
We can do the same thing with CPIs, with one difference:
since CPI are indexes, we don't know the absolute prices.
The standard approach is to find the mean value of the real exchange rate
(or its logarithm) and judge under- or overvaluation by comparing the
real exchange rate to its mean, rather than one.


\subsubsection*{Depreciation and inflation}

We can express the same theory in growth rates, 
with the result that the change in the exchange rate 
(the depreciation of the currency)
should equal the difference in the two inflation rates.
Simply put, 
if one country has a higher inflation rate than another, 
then we would expect its currency to fall in value
by the difference.  
That's not true over short periods of time, 
but the basic idea is right.
Countries with high inflation rates also find
that their currencies fall in value.  

Here's how that works.  
The PPP relation  equation (\ref{eq:ppp}), implies 
\begin{eqnarray*}
    e_t &=& P_t/P_t^* .
\end{eqnarray*}
(Feel free to put $\approx$ here if you prefer.)  
If we take (natural) logs both sides, we have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \log e_t &=& \log P_t - \log P_t^* .
\end{eqnarray*}
If we take the same equation at two different dates, 
we have 
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \log e_{t+1}-\log e_{t} &=& 
        (\log P_{t+1}-\log P_{t}) - (\log P^{*}_{t+1}-\log P^{*}_{t}) \\
                &=& \pi_{t+1} - \pi^*_{t+1} .
\end{eqnarray*}
In words:  the depreciation rate equals the difference in the inflation rates.  
It's simply PPP in growth rates.  


Does this work?  
It's pretty good for long-run averages (5-10 years or more), 
but like everything we know about exchange rates, 
not very useful for short-term movements outside very 
very high inflation situations.  

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{venezuela.eps}
    \caption{Venezuela: Bolivar depreciation and inflation differential.}
    \label{fig:venezuela}
\end{figure}

By way of example, consider the exchange rate between the Venezuelan
Bolivar and the US dollar. Between January 1985 and January 2006,
Venezuela's average annual inflation rate was 30\%, as opposed to
the US's 2.9\%. In the same period, the Bolivar
depreciated at the average yearly rate of 27.9\%, i.e. only .8\%
more than implied by the PPP condition. In the short-run, however,
deviations from PPP are the norm.
Figure~\ref{fig:venezuela} shows that this has definitely been the
case for the Bolivar: there have been plenty of periods in which
exchange rate depreciation did not track closely the inflation
differential with the United States. In some instances, in
particular in the late 80's, the deviations were due to the central
bank's attempt to keep the exchange rate constant.
In other cases (the early 90s for example), the deviations
had probably nothing to do with central bank interventions.

%
In developed countries, inflation differentials are typically small,
so they don't give us much insight into the relatively
large movements in exchange rates.  


\subsubsection*{Interest rate parity and the carry trade (skim only)}

%  ?? change
%  interest diff and uip
%  carry trade and predictions

Exchange rates also play a role in interest rate differences across
countries. In June 2004, for example, 3-month eurodollar deposits
paid interest rates of 1.40\% in US dollars, 4.78\% in British
pounds, 5.48\% in Australian dollars, and 2.12\% in euros. If
international capital markets are so closely connected, why do we see
such differences?  The answer is that these returns are
expressed in different currencies, so they're not directly comparable.

Let's think about how prices of currencies show up in interest rate
differentials. We'll start with a relation called {\em covered
interest parity}, which says that interest rates denominated in
different currencies are the same once you ``cover'' yourself
against possible currency changes.  The argument follows the
standard logic of arbitrage used endlessly in finance.  Let's
compare two equivalent strategies for investing one US dollar for 3
months. The first strategy is to invest one dollar in a 3-month
euro-dollar deposit (with the stress on ``dollar''). After three
months that leaves us with $(1+i/4)$  dollars, where $i$ is the
dollar rate of interest expressed as an annual rate.

What if we invested one dollar in euro-denominated instruments? Here
we need several steps to express the return in dollars and make it
comparable to the first strategy. Step one is to convert the dollar
to euros, leaving us with $1/e$ euros ($e$ is the spot exchange rate
-- the dollar price of one euro). Step two is to invest this money
in a 3-month euro deposit, earning the annualized rate of return
$i^{*}$. That leaves us with $(1+i^{*}/4)/e$ euros after three
months. We could convert it at the spot rate prevailing three months
from now, but that exposes us to the risk that the euro will fall.
An alternative is to sell euros forward at price $f$. In three
months, we will have $(1+i^{*}/4)/e$ euros that we want to convert
back to dollars. With a three-month forward contract, we arrange now
to convert them at the forward rate $f$ expressed, like $e$, as
dollars per euro. This strategy leaves us with $(1+i^{*}/4)f/e$
dollars after three months.

Thus we have two relatively riskless  strategies, one yielding
$(1+i/4)$, the other yielding $(1+i^{*}/4)f/e$. Which is better?
Well, if either strategy had a higher payoff, you could short one
and go long the other, earning extra interest with no risk.
Arbitrage will tend to drive the two together:
\begin{equation}
                            (1+i/4) \;=\; (1+i^{*}/4)f/e.
                            \label{eq:cip}
\end{equation}
We call (\ref{eq:cip}) {\it covered interest parity\/}.
Currency traders assure us that covered interest parity
is an extremely good approximation in the data.
The only difference between the left and right sides is a bid-ask spread,
which averages less than 0.05\% for major currencies.


A related issue is whether international differences
in interest rates reflect differences in expected depreciation rates.
Does the high rate on Aussie dollars (AUD)
reflect the market's assessment that
the AUD will fall in value relative to (say) the euro?
To see how this works, suppose
we converted the proceeds of our foreign investment
back to local currency at the exchange rate prevailing
in 3 months.  Our return would then be
\[
                            (1+i^{*}/4) e_{3}/e ,
\]
where $e_3$ is the spot exchange rate 3 months in the future.
This investment is risky, since we don't know what the
future exchange rate will be, but we might expect
it to have a similar expected return to a local investment.
That is,
\begin{equation}
                            (1+i/4) \;=\; (1+i^{*}/4) E (e_{3})/e ,
                            \label{eq:uip}
\end{equation}
where $E(e_3)$ is our current expectation
of the exchange rate in 3 months.
This relation is an application of the expectations hypothesis to
currency prices (the forward rate equals the expected future spot rate)
that is commonly referred to as {\it uncovered interest parity\/}.


In fact, uncovered interest rate parity doesn't work.
It implies that high interest rate currencies depreciate,
when in fact they appreciate (increase in value) on average,
making them good (if risky) investments.
If $i>i^*$, we invest at home.  If $i<i^*$, we invest abroad,
expecting to pocket not only the higher interest rate but
an appreciation of the currency ($e_3>e$).
That's the essence of what is called the ``carry trade.'' 
Why this investment opportunity persists remains something of a mystery to
academics and investors alike.
Two fine points:  (i)~This feature of the data does not apply to
the currencies of developing countries, where higher interest rates
typically imply future depreciation.
That is, uncovered interest parity works better here.  
(ii)~Even in developed countries, forecasts of exchange rate changes based on interest differentials have an $R^2$ of 0.05 or less.
That's still useful for investment purposes,
but leaves most of the variance of exchange rate changes unexplained.


\subsubsection*{Predicting exchange rates}

Let's summarize what we've learned about movements in exchange rates:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item PPP works reasonably well over long periods of time,
but has little empirical content over periods of less than a few years,
and virtually none over periods under a year.

\item Interest rate differentials have some forecasting power,
with high interest rate currency increasing in value on average,
the they leave most of the variance of exchange rate movements
 unexplained.
\end{itemize}
%
Can we do better than this?
A little, but probably no more than that.
It's extremely hard to forecast exchange rates better than
a 50-50 bet on up or down.
Interest differentials do a little better, but only a little.
The $R^2$ are less than 0.05.
We may be able to do better still
using more complex theory or personal judgment about policy,
but years of failure suggest that
it's very hard to beat a random walk consistently.



\subsubsection*{Executive summary}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In the long run, exchange rates tend to
equalize prices of products across countries (PPP).

\item In the short run, exchange rate movements are large
and unpredictable.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Review questions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Forecasting the euro.
Right now, the euro is ``overvalued'' in PPP terms relative to the
dollar (goods are more expensive in Europe) and Euro Zone short-term interest rates remain 2-3\% above US interest rates.
Given these facts, how would you expect the euro/dollar exchange rate to change over the next 6 months?  6 years?
How good is each of these informed guesses?

Answer.  Purchasing power parity is a long-run ``anchor'' for the
exchange rate:  if prices of goods and services in the Euro Zone
are higher than those in the US, when expressed in a common currency,
we'd expect the euro to fall in value relative to the dollar
--- eventually.
This is pretty much useless over a period as short as 6 months,
but has some content over 6 years.
More useful in the short-run is the interest differential.
Since the Euro interest rate is higher, we'd expect the euro to increase in value.
Neither works all that well:  an $R^2$ of 0.05 would be good over
periods of a few months.
