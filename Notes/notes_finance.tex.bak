\bigskip
Some of the most important markets for aggregate economic performance
are those for labor and (financial) capital,
which affect every industry and product.
Countries differ markedly in their treatment of both markets,
with (evidently) different outcomes as a result.

Our focus here is on financial markets,
which are perhaps the most difficult markets to manage effectively.


\subsubsection*{Financial markets}

Financial markets are central to economic performance,
because they facilitate (if they work well)
the allocation of resources to the most productive firms.
In the US today,
some firms borrow from banks,
others issue bonds and equity in capital markets,
and still others raise money through venture capitalists.
Countries differ widely in how they do this,
but they all have ways of channeling funds from
households (savers) to firms (borrowers).


The primary issue with financial markets is information,
and we know that markets sometimes handle information poorly.  
Here investors need to understand the risks faced by borrowers, 
but borrowers typically know more about themselves than others do.  
A bank, for example, needs to know enough about its borrowers to 
assess the risk of default, 
and its depositors need to know enough about the bank's ability to 
do this well to assess the risk to their deposits.  

None of this is easy to do.  
All of these financial arrangements 
require institutional support.
An effective financial system requires some version of
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Creditor protection.
If A loans money to B, it's essential that A's claim be honored.
That requires a legal system that makes
the creditor's rights clear and enforces them if necessary.
[You might be thinking about ``property rights'' and the ``rule of law''
about now.]
Without this, people will simply not make loans.
Or they make loans only to friends and relatives.
Weak ineffective financial systems follow naturally
when creditors are not protected.

\item Governance.
The laws of most countries give creditors some
say over the management of firms.
Equity investors, for example,
are represented (in principle) by boards of directors.
There's endless debate about how best to do this,
but there's no question doing it well is important.

\item Disclosure.
When people invest in securities, they need to understand what
they're buying.
In most countries with active securities markets,
the law dictates disclosure of relevant financial information.
Again, some countries do this better than others.
\end{itemize}

Measures of these things are available from a number
of sources,
including the World Bank's Doing Business

\subsubsection*{Financial regulation and crises}

The challenge of managing a financial system is not only
to get capital allocated efficiently,
but to avoid the periodic crises financial systems
tend to experience.
If financial development gets ahead of the institutional environment,
the risk of a crisis is higher.
That's one of the reasons China has resisted more rapid
liberalization of its financial system:
the risk of disruption is more than they're willing to bear.

It's hard to strike the right balance here.
In the US, bank panics were a common occurrence
up through the 1930s.
During the Depression,
hundreds of banks went under.
Some of them were insolvent.
Others closed because depositors demanded their money back
for fear that the bank would go under:
what we call bank runs.
It's hard to say for sure,
but it looks like there's a degree of self-fulfilling
prophecy here.

So what do you do?
One way to stop bank runs is to provide deposit insurance.
Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz called federal
deposit insurance ``the most important structural change''
made in the 1930s to deal with bank runs.
And it worked:  bank runs pretty much ended.

But like many solutions, it raised new problems.
The problem with deposit insurance is what economists call ``moral hazard''
and others might call the ``other people's money'' problem.
Since banks don't face the risk of withdrawal,
they have less reason to control the risk of their investments.
We found out in the 1980s S\&L crisis that this problem could be pretty expensive.
That's led to a complex regulatory structure intended
to keep banks from taking excessive risks
and thus protect the taxpayers who backstop the system.


Evidently it's hard to get the right balance:
an effective financial system without undue risk of crisis. ...
