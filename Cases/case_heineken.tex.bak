As the new marketing director of the Heineken brand for Heineken USA,
you are beginning to realize that exchange rates compete with
advertising campaigns for your attention.
Heineken is the \#2 imported beer in the US
(after Grupo Modelo's Corona) and an important source of revenue and earnings
for your parent company, Heineken NV.
You have learned that your margins depend to a large extent on
the strength of the euro relative to the dollar
and wonder what you might do about it.

You don't know much (yet) about the business or exchange rates,
but have been given these numbers to work with:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep=0.01in \topsep=0.01in
\item One unit:  one 6-pack (6 355-ml bottles or the equivalent).
\item Monthly volume:  15 million units.
\item Exchange rate:  one euro is currently worth  1.35 dollars.
\item Production costs for US delivery:  2.50 euros.
\item US distribution and marketing expenses:  2.00 dollars.
\item US wholesale price:  7.00 dollars.
\item Elasticity of demand in US market:  $-3.0$.
\end{itemize}

You know very little about exchange rates,
so you turn to your recently-hired assistant,
the proud owner of a Stern MBA.
You ask her to write a memo answering these questions:
%
\begin{itemize} %\itemsep=0.01in \topsep=0.01in
\item How much money are you making per unit?  %Altogether?

\item What happens to your margin if the euro rises 12\%?
How likely is that?

\item What strategies would you recommend to deal with
the inevitable movements in the  exchange rate?
\end{itemize}
