As the new marketing director of the Heineken brand for Heineken USA,
you are beginning to realize that exchange rates compete with
advertising campaigns for your attention.
Heineken is the \#2 imported beer in the US
(after Grupo Modelo's Corona) and an important source of revenue and earnings
for your parent company, Heineken NV.
You have learned that your margins depend to a large extent on
the strength of the euro relative to the dollar
and wonder what you might do about it.

You don't know much (yet) about the business or exchange rates,
but have been given these numbers to work with:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep=0.01in \topsep=0.01in
\item One unit:  one 6-pack (6 355-ml bottles or the equivalent).
\item Monthly volume:  15 million units.
\item Exchange rate:  one euro is currently worth  1.35 dollars.
\item Production costs for US delivery:  1.96 euros.
\item US distribution and marketing expenses:  2.25 dollars.
\item US wholesale price:  6.75 dollars.
\item Elasticity of demand in US market:  $-3.0$.
\end{itemize}

You know very little about exchange rates,
so you turn to your recently-hired assistant,
the proud owner of a Stern MBA.
You ask her to write a memo answering these questions:
%
\begin{itemize} %\itemsep=0.01in \topsep=0.01in
\item How much money are you making per unit?  %Altogether?

\item What happens to your margin if the euro rises 15\%?
How likely is that?

\item What overall pricing strategy would you recommend to deal with
the inevitable movements in the  exchange rate?
\end{itemize}

{\it Acknowledgement.\/}  This project is motivated by Rebecca Hellerstein,
an economist at the New York Fed who studies pricing strategies of international businesses, including brewers.

{\bf Sketch of an answer:}

\begin{itemize}

\item The idea is to estimate the annual standard deviation (volatility)  of the euro,
either by taking year-on-year changes or extrapolating changes
over shorter intervals.
Or you could look at the implied volatility for currency options.
Estimates vary, but a ballpark volatility is 0.15 = 15\%.
If we assume a normal distribution (wrong, but a good place to start)
then the probability of an annual change greater than 2/3 of a standard deviation in either direction is about 50\%.
[The standard normal is greater than 2/3 about 25\% of the time;
in Excel, try ``1--NORMSDIST(2/3)''.]

\item The euro is overvalued by the Big Mac index (Big Macs are
more expensive in the EuroZone) but that is relatively
unhelpful in forecasting the exchange rate over the next year.
Interest rates are lower in the EZ, but interest rates (like prices)
have only modest power to forecast exchange rates.
You won't go far wrong by assuming that the exchange rate is unpredictable.

\item A good starting point:
apply the pricing formula from Firms \& Markets:
\[
    p  \;=\;  \mbox{MC} \left( \frac{1} {1+1/\varepsilon} \right) .
\]
where $\varepsilon$ is the price elasticity of demand ($-3$ in this case).
We'll assume the elasticity is constant, which means the demand curve has the form
\[
    q \;=\; a p^{\displaystyle \varepsilon} .
\]
With the given numbers, $\mbox{MC} = 1.96*1.184 + 1.75 = 4.07$
and the optimal price is $ 6.106$ (roughly what we report).
If the euro rises 10\%, then $\mbox{MC}$ rises to 4.30 and the optimal price
rises to 6.454.
In words:  higher cost leads you to raise your price.

Comment:  Note that we have violated PPP at the micro level.
The price of beer doesn't change in Euroland (we didn't say that, but let's
assume that's the case) and rises by 5.7\% in the US --- in dollars.
In euros, the US price of Heineken has fallen by (approximately) 4.3\%,
so it's gotten less expensive in the US relative to Europe.
Why the difference?  Because of local content,
the US costs that go into US sales.
No doubt there are other reasons, too, but you get the idea:
there's no reason to expect
PPP to work as anything but a rough approximation.

Continuing with the calculations: volume falls by about 17\%
(the price rise multiplied by the elasticity $-3$) and revenue
falls by the difference.
In proportional terms, profit falls by the same amount as revenue.

Bottom line (in case you got lost):
In business terms, your costs have gone up.  What do you do?
You raise price, but this lowers your volume
(and, presumably, your market share).

\item What about the peso?
Corona is a leading competitor in the imported beer market,
so anything that affects its cost of production will
indirectly affect Heineken.
In fact, Heineken was the leading imported beer in the US for decades.
But following the peso crisis in December 1994,
Corona's cost of production fell sharply (a weak peso),
which they used to increase their market share
(lower price, aggressive marketing, brilliant use of limes
to cover a nondescript product).
They've been number one ever since.

\end{itemize}

2005 version:

You're in the treasury department of a large European retailer.  The company has a significant
cash position that it invests in ``money market'' securities (maturities under six months). Given
the low returns currently available on Euro-zone paper, your team is exploring the possibility of
investing farther afield.  After spending an hour at the Bloomberg terminal, you suggest to your
boss that she consider Australia, where money market rates are well above US and Euro-zone rates.
She recalls, however, that Australia has a current account deficit of more than 5\% of GDP. Noting
that current account deficits in Mexico, Korea, and Argentina were followed by massive
depreciations of their currencies, she asks you to write a short report summarizing your view of
the Australian dollar and addressing, in particular, these issues:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item The current account:  how long has the deficit persisted, and why? Does it pose a risk to
the Auzzie dollar (AUD)?

\item The real exchange rate:  is the AUD expensive or cheap in a PPP sense?

\item Other factors that could lead to a significant depreciation over the next six months.
\end{enumerate}

Not knowing where to start, you contact your Global Economy professor, who suggests the following:

\item For economic and political analysis of Australia, try the Economist Intelligence Unit's

the Country Profile.

\item For macroeconomic data, try the EIU's

\item For current analysis, try investment bank reports (access varies, but use your contacts).
