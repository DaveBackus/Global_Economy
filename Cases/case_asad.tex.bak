Shinzo Abe was elected Prime Minister of Japan in December 2012
after two decades of slow growth and falling prices.
He pledged dramatic policy changes to revive the Japanese economy,
dubbed the ``three arrows'' of ``Abenomics.''
We consult the Economist Intelligence Unit and press reports for specifics:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Fiscal stimulus.  A sizeable economic stimulus package was passed by parliament in
February 2013, and a smaller one in October.
This is expected to produce a budget deficit of 8\% in 2013.
\item Monetary stimulus. A plan to double Japan's
money supply within two years was implemented in April 2013 to help to achieve the Bank of Japan's
target of 2\%  inflation.
\item Structural reform.
This is less clearly articulated, but some observers hope for a range of micro-based reforms,
including loosening product-market regulations that reduce productivity,
tightening corporate requirements for funding pensions,
creating a more flexible labor market,
and reducing subsidies to an inefficient agricultural sector.
\end{itemize}
%
Your mission is to explore the impact of the three arrows using the aggregate supply and demand
framework.
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain, for each ``arrow,'' whether it affects supply or demand.
Which way does each one shift the appropriate curve(s)?
(15~points)
\item Compare the short- and long-term impact on output of the three policies.
Which are likely to have the greatest impact in the short term?
In the long term?
(15~points)
\end{itemize}

\begin{comment}
This continues to be topical.
Here's a
\href{http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-12/abe-pushes-biggest-farm-revamp-since-macarthur-broke-landlords.html}
{recent comment} about agricultural policy.

\begin{itemize}
\item We have:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fiscal stimulus. This shifts aggregate demand to the right.
\item Monetary stimulus. Same.
\item Structural reform. This shifts both aggregate supply curves to the right.
\end{itemize}
Grading:  5 points for each bullet done correctly.
The graphs need not be included, but if they are they should be correct.

\item Fiscal and monetary stimulus will raise output in the short run.
They have no long-run impact on output.

Structural reform, on the other hand, raises output both short-term and long-term.
In this respect, it's likely the most important of the arrows.
(Also, unfortunately, the one that's been executed least effectively.)

Grading: 5 points for each one.
Also:  the original question asks for the short and long-term impact, and doesn't
specify output, so answers might include comments about the impact on prices.
\end{itemize}

OLD STUFF \\
You have rotated into the economic analysis group at JP Morgan Chase,
reporting to US Chief Economist Michael Feroli.
As your first assignment, he asks you to work through the possible impact
on the US economy of further deterioration in Europe.
He suggests that this might affect the US economy through three channels.
First, Europeans may buy fewer US products.
Second, financial conditions in Europe might spill over to the US,
making it more difficult, for example, for US firms to finance expansion.
And third, the loss of confidence there might lead to a fall
in confidence of US business leaders.


You go back to your Global Economy notes, in particular the
chapters on the aggregate supply and demand model,
where you find this figure:

You remind yourself what it means and write down some questions:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item Where is the current short-run equilibrium in this diagram?
Does that seem right to you?
\item Do Feroli's channels correspond to changes in supply or demand?
\item If you decide the primary effect is on demand, how would you expect
GDP growth and inflation to respond in the short run?  In the long run?
\item What, if anything, do you think is missing from this analysis?
\end{itemize}
