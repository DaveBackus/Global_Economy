The cabbie instantly returned one of the bills, declaring it counterfeit.</P>
<P>Kehoe, a University of Minnesota economist, apologized and explained that someone must have passed off the fake five-peso note as change from an earlier transaction in the Argentinian capital.</P>
<P>In a rare case of a cab driver offering a tip, the driver suggested that Kehoe pass the bogus bill at a crowded newsstand, where no one would be likely to notice.</P>
<P>The tale reflects the core of Kehoe's work: he examines how countries cope with economic crises, for good or for ill.</P>
<P>Argentina is a nation plagued by crime, a faltering banking system, double-digit unemployment and a collapsing currency. (The value of a real five-peso bill is about $1.40 today. Little more than a year ago, it fetched nearly $5.)</P>
<P>Argentina's economic crisis is a recent example of what's become a more common phenomenon, particularly in Latin America.</P>
<P>"The average [Argentine] standard of living in the last year has fallen something like 20 percent," Kehoe said. "Some formerly middle-class people are out begging in the street. That sort of thing can just destroy a society."</P>
<P>For the past 20 years, devising new ways to examine causes and consequences of international economic distress has been at the center of Kehoe's research. At 49, he's become a widely followed scholar in the field.</P>
<P>Kehoe's résumé is dotted with international experience. He has been a visiting professor or lecturer at universities in England, Spain and Mexico. He logged more than 120,000 miles in the air last year alone.</P>
<P>Along the way, he's advised governments in Mexico, Spain and Panama on how to integrate their economies with the rest of the world by lowering trade barriers and restrictions on the movement of capital.</P>

<!--JUMPLINE--></P>

<P>Kehoe builds economic models that spin through computers and churn out scenarios of the consequences of imposing new taxes and scrapping old ones or opening borders to imports of food or manufactured goods.</P>
<P>But don't call Kehoe a "consultant" -- a word that makes him recoil because he associates it with the image of a hired gun. Kehoe's goal is about advancing research and building a new generation of economic thinkers.</P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="subhead">Ease with languages </SPAN> </P>
<P>But Kehoe's interests now are a long way from where he started.</P>
<P>The son of a Navy engineer and a mother trained in mathematics and Latin, Kehoe showed an early interest in numbers, language and science.</P>
<P>His younger brother, University of Minnesota economist Patrick Kehoe, recalls Tim winning an Ohio state science fair in high school by simulating the thin atmosphere in Mars. He grew moss and bacteria under a bell jar and used dry ice to create an other-world atmosphere.</P>
<P>In an earlier childhood experiment, Tim spun Patrick in a clothes dryer in emulous astronaut training. The elder brother notes that the dryer heat was off and that he gave his brother a pillow as a cushion. No one was injured.</P>
<P>When Tim was an undergraduate at Providence College in Rhode Island (the Kehoes settled long enough in New England for him to acquire a distinct Yankee accent), he switched majors from chemistry to economics after being inspired by a gifted professor.</P>
<P>While at Yale University in the 1970s and Cambridge University in the 1980s, Kehoe made friends with a number of Spanish and Mexican students who later went on to become influential economists or government officials in their own countries. Those links put Kehoe on the path to working on questions involving trade and other international economic issues.</P>
<P>With the encouragement of friends, Kehoe brushed up on his high school Spanish and hired a tutor to acquire fluency in Catalan, a language spoken chiefly in the northeast of Spain.</P>
<P>Many colleagues volunteer that they're impressed by Kehoe's facility for languages, especially his decision to learn Catalan. His wife, Jean O'Brien-Kehoe,<!--cq--> characterizes it as Catalan "with a Rhode Island accent."</P>
<P>Jose-Victor Rios-Rull<!--cq-->, a Spanish economist who now teaches at the University of Pennsylvania, said he, Kehoe and other economists take part in annual summer trips to Spain, where they hold seminars and critique the work of budding economists unaccustomed to rigorous examination of their research.</P>
<P>"We have better things to do than listen to people from bad universities," Rios-Rull said. "But we want to improve their economics."</P>
<P>Kehoe said he hopes to encourage economists in Spain and Latin America to become more adept as researchers and policy advisers. "Better economists can elevate the level of debate," Kehoe said.</P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="subhead">Rubbing elbows </SPAN> </P>
<P>Friends and associates describe Kehoe as a man who likes to rub elbows almost as much as he likes to massage numbers.</P>
<P>Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Lucas remembers hanging out with Kehoe and friends in the mid-1980s on a trip to Cambridge University, where Kehoe was a lecturer.</P>
<P>"He was super-hospitable," Lucas said. "He knew what to do after the pubs closed at 11, and we kept going all night. He was a live wire."</P>
<P>His wife can attest to that.</P>
<P>Happy-hour get-togethers with students and faculty members are a routine for Kehoe, who is known to be generous with his words and his wallet.</P>
<P>"He's often picking up the tab," O'Brien-Kehoe said.</P>
<P>Kehoe is almost as mobile as his Navy father, who moved the family a dozen times during Kehoe's childhood. In the past 16 years, Kehoe's home base has been Minneapolis, but he's often on the go.</P>
<P>During the past two decades, Kehoe and collaborators have won more than $1 million in grants from the likes of the National Science Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research.</P>
<P>The money pays for thinking time, for the labor of graduate students who gather and process data and for travel that gives Kehoe first-hand knowledge of what's going on in countries with economic troubles they're trying to treat.</P>
<P>Kehoe believes computer simulations can help solve real-world problems, albeit within limits.</P>
<P>The limits -- the vulnerability of computer models to miss the mark on real-world forecasts -- involve mathematical and economic problems that Kehoe and experts in his field continue to try to solve.</P>
<P>"We have a long way to go," Kehoe said. "As a researcher, I find it exciting. As a policy adviser, I find it a little bit appalling."</P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="subhead">Progress made </SPAN> </P>
<P>Kehoe gets high praise from prominent colleagues for the progress he's made in meeting such challenges.</P>
<P>Herbert Scarf, Kehoe's thesis adviser at Yale, said Kehoe's computer models anticipating the economic consequences of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) helped give trade negotiators evidence that the United States, Mexico and Canada all would be better off after the treaty.</P>
<P>"Can you say anything other than vague and wild things about the sounds of jobs being sucked below the U.S.-Mexico border?" Scarf said. "Tim did."</P>
<P>If Kehoe's forecasts had flaws, the errors were on the side of underestimating the economic growth spawned by NAFTA.</P>
<P>"I think a lot of productivity gains that we've had in the last eight years have been driven by trade, not just with Mexico but with Canada," Kehoe said. "Yet we've seen U.S. trade with Canada has boomed over last eight years, as well."</P>
<P>Lucas, at the University of Chicago, said Kehoe has been a leader in tracking government acts on tax and trade and their economic consequences -- moving targets that are hard to pin down.</P>
<P>"He's one of the people trying to make economic theory dynamic," Lucas said. "He's had a big influence."</P>
<P>That influence extends to the classroom, where Kehoe has trained many economists on both sides of the Atlantic. "He's an inspiring teacher," Lucas said. "His enthusiasm is infectious."</P>
<P>Kehoe's interests extend far beyond economics, research and teaching.</P>
<P>An incessant reader, he brings four or five books to bed every night. "Histories, biographies, junky novels -- anything," O'Brien-Kehoe said of Kehoe's reading list.</P>
<P>Reading sometimes has gotten him in trouble, however.</P>
<P>O'Brien-Kehoe, a historian at the University of Minnesota who met her husband through friends, recalled her frustration when she helped Kehoe move into a condo before they were married.</P>
<P>"I had to kick him out of the living room," she said. "He was supposed to be unpacking the books, but he kept reading them."</P>
<P><SPAN CLASS="subhead">'Very highly respected' </SPAN> </P>
<P>Jaime Serra-Puche, who later went on to become secretary of trade and secretary of finance in Mexico, met Kehoe when they were working on their doctorates at Yale. They became close friends and collaborators on projects involving study of trade and international finance.</P>
<P>"He's a very highly respected economist in Mexico," Serra-Puche said. "I know he's the same in Spain."</P>
<P>Kehoe's latest work promises to be as important as his earlier computer models of economic actions and reactions, Serra-Puche said. </P>
<P>In recent work, Kehoe has examined questions of self-fulfilling prophecies. For example, when everyone in Argentina thinks the government is going to devalue the currency, their behavior -- converting their pesos to U.S. dollars, for instance -- can make peso devaluation inevitable.</P>
<P>Governments need orderly plans for dealing with financial shocks, Kehoe said. Otherwise, they prolong the pain. "Argentina is going to take a long, long time to recuperate from this crisis," he said.</P>
<P>Serra-Puche calls Kehoe's research "what could be absolutely path-breaking work on currency crises."</P>
<P>"He's absolutely brilliant," Serra-Puche said of Kehoe. And, he added, "He's not bad at beer drinking."</P>
